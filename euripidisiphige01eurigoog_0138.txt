IPHIGENIA IN AULIS. 107

Lenting writes the sentence thus, ἄφρων, νέος τ ἦν, πρὶν τοὶ

πρόγματ ἐγγύθεν Σιοπῶν ἐσεῖδον οἶον ην κ. τ. and his con-

jecture is approved by Matthiae, and edited by Hermann. 'ro me
it seems but the awkward twisting of a very plain sentence.

v. 414. Ἄλλως τέ μ έλεος τῆς ταλαιπώρου κόρης Εἰσ-
ῆλθε, συγγένειαν ἐννοουμένῳ] This construction is defended
by a kindred sentence in the Medea, v. 56 ''969'' ιμερθς μ
υτηλθε ’γῆ τε κοὺραυῳ Λέξ αι, μολοέση δεῦρο, Mndeias δτνχαςῑ
where the Scholiast says vd σχῆμα σολοικοφανες,δ ια την
ε’ναλλαγην της ττωσέως. In both placeS, μ is an accusative,
as the diphthong m μοι cannot be elided. Since the old Gram-
marians recognize this figure, and the Comic Poet Philemon, in '
his imitation of the passage of the Medea, has adopted it, Ι have
not hesitated to retain ἐννοουμένῳ in the text. Person however
appears ιο have judged differently, as in the Medea he printed
μολοῦσαν. Markland compares v. 1260. Ota d εἰσῆλθέν μ’
ακονσον, μῆτερ, ἐννοουμένην

v. 418. στρατιαὶ, the reading of Aldus and the MSS„ rs cor-
rected by Barnes.

v. 421. Ei δέ τι κόρης σης θεσφάτων μέτεστί σοι, Mai ,
μοὶ μετέστω ool νέμω τουμδν μέρος] This' rs given according
to the old copies except that 1 have written μη μοὶ instead of
μη uos: Hermann has done the same. Markland thought thatin
the first of these lines we ought to read μέτεστί μοι, and some
editors have followed his advice, but without having duly con.
sidered the meaning of the sentence. l consider Hermann's explana-
tion to be right3 Vaticinium dc filia si curas, ego μου curo, sed
meos partes tibi permitto.

v. 425. α’νδρος ov κακον τροποι Torolds] Certain MSS. have
interlined τροται roralis. Matthiae remarks‘ ‘Qui τροπαὶ τοι·
atde scripsit, sermonem adhuc esse de μεταβολαῖς et τῷ με·
τέπεσον οιεάἰόἰι3’

v. 427. Γευναῖ ελεξας, Τανταλιρ τε τῳ Arde Πρετοντα·
προγονοις ου καταισχύνεις σεθεν] Pierson, Verislm. p. 78. pro·
poses ’γενναῖα λέξα ας. Hermann edites arpoyovoucd. The latter

Ι do not condemn, though ιι does not appear to me necessary. ·
v. 429. Αινω σε, Μενέλα] Aldus Μενέλαος. Musgrave

pointed out the correction Μενέλα MattMae,1ncompliance with
Barnea and Heath, has edited Μενέλεως. 'l'his word' rs indeed ‚
