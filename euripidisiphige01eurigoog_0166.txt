v. 68Ξ. All the editions and MSS. have πόλισμα Τροίας Πέρ-
σας κατάκρας πόλιν Ihave expunged πόλισμα Τροίας, aa being
ιιιι interpretation of what follows, which has crept into the text.
πέρθειν οι αἱρεῖν πόλιν κατάκρας means, arbem et ipram acro·

polin vertare.
v. 683. Instead of πολυκλαυτονς the MSS. have πολυκλαύ-

στονς, which Markland has adopted Iu the following verse, the
insertion of ταν is demanded on account of the measure. 'l'he
three verses which follow have displeased almost all the critics; but
1 am surprisedd that none of them have hitherto perceived that they
are a forgery, A le* Auis Ἑλευα Κόρα πολυιιλαυπος cosdrae
Πόσιν προλιπουσα. 'l'he motiva of the Interpolator for intruding
them, seems to have been, that the allusion to Helen which ensues
might not be too abrupt. But rt is absurdly opposed to the sense of
the passage that the Chorus should express pity for Helen3 and the
stiling her Asos κόρα is a proof of the forgery, since in this
very epode they intimate incredulity with regard to her fabled
parentage. 'l'hese three lines cannot by any contrivance be reduced
to the metre which prevails m the rest of the chorus. Besides, the
word πολύκλαυτος ss borrowed by the Interpolator‚ according to
his practice, from sneighbouring line; and ἐπεῖται for ἔσται is
an open violation of the dialect.

v. 687. ἐλπὶς, expectatio, is here taken ιιι malam partem, as is
frequently the case with ἐλπίζω Ιοιι. 348. Θῆρᾶς σφε πον drio-
τηυον ἐλπίζει κτανεῖν.

v 688. αι πολυχρυσοι Ardor και Φρυγῶν αλοχοι] Hes. 490.
τῶν πολυχρύσων Φρυγῶν. Nicolaus Comicus Stob. xrv. p. 149.
ο Λυδῶν τῶν πολυχρυσων αναξ. 'l'his' rs cited by Elmsley ou
Bacch. 13.

v. 690. For στήσουσι, the readmg of all the copies, Tyrwhitt
proposes σχήσουσι, an unfortunate conjecture. Musgrave com·
pares Soph. OEd. T. 699 μῆνιν-στήσας ἔχεις. Ι have intro-
(luced the Dorio form στάσονσι.

ν. 691. Μυθεῦσαι ‘reid ss αλλήλας] For μνθευσαι, Mat-

thiae has given μυθεύουσαι. Ι οοιιαιιι with Hermarm in thinking
that the common reading is to be retained, as being an Ionio form,
like ὕμνεῦσαι, Med. 423. ἀΰτευν, Hipp. 167. It comes from

the verb μυθὲω, which is acknowledged by Photius in v. μυθή-
σαι· cirtio. It is also ruore agreeable to the matre than μυθεύ-
ονσαι.
