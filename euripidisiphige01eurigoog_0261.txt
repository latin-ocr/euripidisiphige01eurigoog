a line which, being palpably unlike the productiones this intar-¹
polator, Elrnsley (on Heracl. 906) judged to have been taken from
some lost drama of Euripides. Itis impossible that it could have
had a more appropriate place any where than in Diana's address
to Clytaemnestra*

⁸ In an edition of the Iphigenia in Aulis, published at Erlangen in 1887, by .
J. Α, Haemoque, fragments of the speech of Diana taken from the spurious narra-
tive are app-ded to the quotation preserved by AElian. These supposed reliques
οἰ the lost scene are found in vv. 7ο, 78, 79, dudd.

My acquaintance with Hertung's edition hasbeen ton late to enable me to
make any use ot' it. Ι have however looked over his text while this last sheet
is passing through the prees, in order to discover in what cases he may have
anticipated my emendationsr this 1 find he has done in only three instances-v. 919,
partially‚ καί dri πό χρῇζον ἐπίθετ’. 1047. προσοίρισος. 1268. διαβληθῇ. Not
having perused either the prefatory matter, which occupies about 1⁰⁰ peges, or the
nous, 1 am not qualified to explain the vievs oi this editor3 bnt the text pre·
rents a specimen of greater violence than Ι almost ever remember to have seen
inflicted upon an ancient author. He embraces the greater part of Hermann's
most daring alterations, adding many ol his own oi s still harsher character. He
makes a total change in the arrangement nithe verses in severrd scena, as for
instance in the first, which begins with Agamemnon's speech, v. tr, deprived
however of vv. lta-113. 'i'he llnal scene is totally dislocated, presenting an an.
tistrophic eham differing materially from those of Seidler and llerrnenn. The
licence of moving passages backvards and forwerda at his pleaaure is indulged in
without 'compunctionr and while he can find no fault in snch verses as the three
printed at the foot of p. 32, he marks for proscription the two vv. 654, tot, and
illl-825, along with several other passages, which conteln es strong and cha.
racteristic ieamres of the style oi Euripides aa any that can be found ln his works.
