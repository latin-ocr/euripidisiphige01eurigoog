222 NOTES ΟΝ THE

v. 301. ‹ivrip *γαρ χρηστὸς αἰδεῖσθαι φιλεῖ.

ν. 329. συσσωφρονεῖν γαρ, ου’χῖ συννοσεῖν, ἔφυν.

The reading of the first line is derived from stobaeus, of the second
from Plutarch. In our copies of Euripides they stand thus:

v. 301. dvrip γάρ αἰσχρὸς atleied’ ου’ φιλεῖ.

v. 329. συσσωφρονεῖν σοι βούλομ’, ἀλλ’ ovi συννοσεῖν.
Both alterations were made hya corrector, who thought that the
first gave a better meaning, and who could not comprehend the
construction of the second, which is e rarioribus. ln both instances,
indeed, the elision of the diphthong, which he believed to be allow-
able, would have revealed the faults of the verses to modern
scholars; but the true readings could not have been recovered,
had they not been quoted hy writers who possessed unviolated
copies. Many other passages are pointed out in my Notes as the
subject of similar violence. lu some, the true readings have been
ascertained with a probability approaching to demonstration‚ through
a comparison of other passages of the Tragedians, as well as by
attention to the grammatical and metrical rules discovered hythe
exact criticism of later times. Still there remain several in which
the original reading is hopelessly obliterated hythe alteration: 1
speak of such as,

v. 357. οὗτοι aaronis] λὶαν σ’ ἐγώ.

v. 561. οὑκ oid' ὅ τι φής, oris οἶδα, φίλτατ’ ε’μοῒ πάτερ.

v. 574. sis ruvirdaoi θύγατερ, συ’ θ’ ἥκεις opi πατρί.
In these anda few other desperate cases, I have contented myself
with keeping the common reading, and giving iu the margin such
words as might, consistently with the meaning and the practice of
our Poet, have occupied its place.

Resides Boeckh, who would altogether deprive Euripides of the
merit of this Iphigenia, Godfrey Hermann, in his Elementa Doe-
trinoe Marica, publ. in 1818, pronounced the whole of the Parodus,
or first chorio song, to be the production of some poet a little later
than Euripides. ¹When l submitted his opinion to the test of
examination, the result was this: the strophe, antistrophe and
epode printed in this edition bore all evidences which language and
metre could furnish, of the genuine poetry of our Author,· nothing
indeed can be more appropriate aud natural than that the women
-of Chalcis, who had crossed the Euripus to see the Grecian arma-
ment, should recount what they had witnessed, and nothing more
