yon aaa Iphigenia. Bothe and Hermann erese ε’μην, because the

Chalcidians could not call her their Quaen. But had this line been
applied to Clytaemnestra, whose husband was τῶν Πανελλήνων

αναξ, perhaps no one would cavil at her being styled by these Grecian
ladies, ἄνασσα ε’μήτ and to say the truth, I should he better pleased

with this passage, if the title were bestowed on the mother instead
of the daughter, and if the sentence ran thus, Την του βασιλέως

Hermann has substituted Oroi τοι κρείσσους, very unfortunately,
for the sentence is impeired by: the· expulsionof the article: see

pereeived that the languflge required the erasure of τῶν, and
the observation just made on the correspondence of the matres, of
