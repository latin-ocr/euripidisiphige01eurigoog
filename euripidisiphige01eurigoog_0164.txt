lrfflounlil IN AULIS. 133

v. 658 ‘'Ayvpu Ελλάνιον στρατιᾶς] This line corresponds
with the antistrophic, prss,'' οταν χάλκασπις Ἅρηςμ although
it begins with a short syllable. This' rs perfectly consistent with
the laws of the Glyconeus Polysch.'and there' rs no necessity for
Markland’s inversion of the words, or for Gaisford's writing
ἄγυρις with the article. There is the same licence in the verse
following, as well as in all the regular choruses oi this Tragedy.

v. 659. vovolv volgo; but most MSS. have νανσῖ.

, v. 662. τάν Κασσάνδραν. Matthiae wishes τάν to be ex-

punged for the sake of the measure, while m fact 1t is necessary fo'r
the measure. He has als'o rejected the preposition in v. 673, which
oue MS. omits by accident. All the editions had Κασσάνδραν,
611 Gaisford gave it with a single σ, 11 being so written in one or
two MSS. and that being the ordinary way of spelling the name
in the editions of the Tragedies. But l cannot perceive any rea'son
why the orthography found in Homer and other Poets should ²be
changed, and therefore 'agree with Hermann that Κασσάνδραν

ought to be restored.

v. 663. Elmsley (ori Heracl. 149) 11166666 comma 6116ιρ111-
τειν, that rt mays stand for ῥίπτειν ἑαντην, asin Cycl. 165. Pipae
τ’ ἐς αλμὴν. But the construction of ρι’πτειν ξανθονς πλοκάμους
seems to 1116111016116111161,6111111166661166161611116 passage. Com.-
pare Bacch. 150. Τρνφεράν πλόκαμον εις αἱθὲρα’ ριπτινν.

v. 666 Instead of μαντόσυνοι, 1116 ο1(1 editions have παντό-
σννοι, but this seems to have originated with the Aldine compo-
sitor: the MSS. have' 11 11ο1.

v. 670. ενπάροισι πλάταις Aldus. But all the MSS. ενπριά ¹

pots or ενπριάροισι, which Musgrave restored to the text, quoting
v. 632. εὐπρύμνοισιν Αργεῖων πλάταις.
v. 672. Orest 799. Παρά Σιμουντίοις οχετοῖς.

v. 673. Τάν τιον ἐν αιθὲρι δισσῶν Διοσκούρων Ελὲναν] The
re'ader will here notice the rather uncommon ellipsis ol' αόελφῆν.

See Wesseling on Diod. 1 p. 312. 116 cites Act. Aposti. 13.
ἸάκωβοιἈλφαίοο, 61111Α1616111ο11“11.1.Τιμοκράτη6 ο Μητρο-

δώρου, in both which places we must understand ἀδελφάς.

atvs. Πέργαμονδε, εΦρνὙῶν πόλιν] Ihope that no reader
'will be offended at my having ventured to place ερνμα 111 1116 neigh'-
bourhood of the text. This line, to say the least, sonnds strangely‚
