IPHIGENIA IN AULlS¹ 1'83

γλιιῖσσα καί με’λος παρῆν, Ὥστ’ ἢ κόρην Δήμητρος, ἢ κείνης
πύσιν Ὗιινοισι κηλήσαντά α’ ἐξ Αίδαο λαβεῖν, Κατῇλθον dv.

v. 1107. is one of those quoted by Porson (Suppl. Praes. od Hec.
p. 31) as instanoes of the fifth foot being a Spondee although di-
vided between two words, the second being, like μοι, an enclitic.
Elmsley (on Med. 56. note z.) wishes to alter the reading 3 he says,
“Si plura legerentur qualia σούρίζει (σοι ὁρίζει) apud AEsch.
Choeph. 927. σούπισθεν apud Arist. Thesm. 195. auctor essem ut
reponeretur apud Euripidem lph. A. πείθειν ἑτᾴθονσ’, ὥστε μού-
μαρπεῖν πέτρας.” But I think that the examples of lines similar
to the present, given by Porson, should be sufficient to deter from
such attempts at alteration. One Par. MS. has uerddooo' for

duddovo', and hereon Hermann founds a different ‚reading3 in his
text the v'erse is Πείθειν μ’ ἑπάδουσάν θ’ ὁμαρτεῖν μοι πέτρας.

v. 1110. Commonly δυναίμεθα. Markland and Porson duvai-
‚ μεθ’ ἂν, which was first admitted into the text by Gaisford.

ν. 1111. Ἱκετηρίαν dc γόνατος ἐξάπτω σέθεν Τά σῶμα
τούμόν] γόνατος for γόνασιν is the emendation of Markland,

which 1 have adopted after some hesitation. Matthiae defends
the construction γόνασιν ἐξάπτω in Gr. Gram. §377. by such
quotations as Hom. Il. Ξ. 115. Πορθεῖ δὲ τρεῖς παῖδες ἀμύμο-
νες ἐξεγένοντο, ωενι born to Ροήίιιιιες but such expressions
admit of no comparison with ours. I am not prepared to deny
that a poet might possibly have used a dative aster ἐξάπτω τά
σῶμα τούμιίν, that expression being equivalent to npoorrirr‘rw:
. but no reason can be found for Euripides abandoning in this
instance the natural construction, and 1 think therefore that ιι
transcribet had his eye caught by γόνασι in v. 1116. or perhaps

thought that the plural was preferable to the singular in such a
case3 if so, he was certainly mistaken.

v.1114. All the 'copies of Euripides have Βλέπειν· τά d'
ύπιί γῆς μή μ’ ἰδεῖν ἀναγκάσῃς. But Plutarch, who cites this
and the preceding line, has λεύσσειν and ύπό γῆν. The former

is strongly recommended by Porson, who proves that scholiasts
used to explain λεύσσω by βλέπω. See Alberti on Hesych. vv.

λεύσσει, λεύσσων. lad γῆς, scil. ὄντα, appears to be the requisite

accusativus, ni fallor, in tali locutione tantum adhibetur cum
motus aliquis significatur, ut supr. ν. 47. Κάπάξομαί γε νερτέ-
