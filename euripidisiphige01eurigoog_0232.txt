’ v. 1265. Kdv ἐμοί πορθμός τι ναῶν] Many critica have
illustrated by exemplet this well known Graeciam, and among tte
rest Blomfield (Gloss. AEsch. Pers. 117) who ιιι quoting this line
proposes to read κάν ἐμοί νεῶν τι nopiiudst but the common
order os the words seems to me preferable. ναὸι and ναῶν are
used by the Tragedians as frequently as venie and νεῶν.

ν. 1267. ΤΙιο copies have Mnse‘d' dpwdg‘ers’ ιᾳν eds ὀλβίας

ἐξ Ἑλλάδος, Tdv Ελένηι τίσοντας ὅλιθρον,” ηντιν '‘il’W‘V
Παρις. The second of these lines 1 consider to be spurious lt
is the only rntrusion made by the interpolator upon the trochaica of
this drama. Musgrave remarked how inappropriate it was to call
Helen' s abduction τᾶν Ελένηι dhedpov, andhe endecadem trahil
separes comma ηντιν’ ἥρπασεν Πάρις. He might have added
that τίσοντας ιι used ιιι a wrong signification, and that 'JWW
is adopted where the simple relative ην ιι required. But this lint
is ιιοι without its value, if· ιι assist us in correcting that which
precedes Porsen ιιι Praef. ad Hec. p xuiii. ιιι noticing that the
trocheis caesura cannot rest upon on article or preposition, says,
Leviter corruptus Iph. A. 1391. et leuiter corrigendum τάσδ’ pro ται
of this correction, whiehis adopted by Μιιιιιιιι, Hermann observes,
quo nihil fingi molestius potest. While I agree with this censure,
1 am disposed to say of Hermann’s reading, τιν’ sor τᾶς, quo silit
fingi ⁵{rigidius potest. What may be said of my own emendation,
τοιίσ ' for τᾶς, Ι will not anucipate ς but 1 will urge in its defenoe,
that Iphigenia may be supposed to look at Achilles and his soldiers,
who are designated by ‘seriori’ in v. 1245, and that the interpolator's
word, ricoarae, seems to argue that he had found vodel in the
old copy of the Poet which he used.

v. 1270. The reading of almost all edd.’ rs ital γὰρ oiie' eret

the MSS. have καί ’γοὶρ oneror λίανὲμιφ χ. Ιι will be ob·
served that ἑνιι, ιιοι ἐμοί, is required both by the syntax and the
metre. 1 have adopted the first correction of Elmsley (Edinb. Rea.
Vol. ιιι. p. 92) οὐδέ τοι τι λίαν, particularly as one of the Paris
Mss. hoe olie' τοι, the other oili τι, efactof which Elmsley was
not aware. He atterwards (Mus. crit. Vol. ιι. p. 282) proposed ιι
different reading, οὑχ οιίτιο τι λίαν, on various accounts less
probable than that which Hermann and myself have admitted.
