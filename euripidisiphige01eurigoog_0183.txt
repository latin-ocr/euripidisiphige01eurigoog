ν.8.36 Τοσοντονῖ ο κτον περιβαλών καταστελῶ] Hermann

“ ν. 844. All the editions have a comma aiter παρθένος, and
then θαυμαστοὶ d ως α’νοῖξι’ ιητιμασμένη. Ι consider that this
line begins a new sentence: and have, not without confidente,
given ἦτιιιάσμεθα for ἡτιιιασιιενη. lt was himself to whom
Achilles considered that the iudignity was offered, not Iphigenia;
her usage he had already described ιιι different and more appro-

priate language. The verse is thus properly connected with what
follows. Elmsley (Mur. crit. 1. p. 481.) would read ἡτιμωμὲνη,

from Helen 462. Ωδαῖμον, ως ἀνάξι ἠτιμώμεθα.

v.849 Εἴπερ φονεύει τονμον ονομα σιρ πόσει] The copies

fluctuate ιιι the reading of the first word of this line between
ειπερ, ὥσπερ, ὅσπερ, and* οπερ. But the common reading,

ειπερ, is correct, and there rs no need of any of the conjectures

hazarded on this verse: the meaning is, If ιιιρ nome acts tte mur-
derer for ροιιν Ιιιιιόαιιά,· i. e. server Ιιὶιιι for on enecationer.
