trlcal nature of the line contributes to its condemnatidn.
v. 1406. In Ald. the scene concludes with these four lines,

Ἀγαμέμνονά τε λόγχαις

Ἑλλάδι κλεινότατον στέφανον

dds ἀμφὶ κόρα τὲον

κλέος ἀείμνηστον ἀμφιθεῖναι.
But all the MSS. have ἀμφὶ κάρα ἕόντ such then was the reading
of the parent manuscript, from which all our other copies of the
play have been taken; τεόν seems to have been an insertion of
the Aldine editor, in order to avoid the hiatus, and at the same
time to make Agamemnon, when victorious, crown the head of
Diana's image, as Hippolytus does, with a chaplet But Ι believe that
all this flows from ascholium, ἀμφὶ κόρα ἑόν, written over α’μ·
φιθεῖναι by some one who mismok the meaning: hence it was
adopted into the text. The verb α’μφιθεῖναι is construed with a
dative. Compare Suppl. 315. Πόλει παρόν σοι σλέφανον εὐκλείας

λαβεῖν. Tro. 565. στέφανον ἔφερεν Ἑλλάδι κουροτρόφῳ.
Whetherl have corrected the line in the best manner by prefixing
dds τ’ to Ἀγαμ. Ι feel very doubtful: but as the metre puts

on a dactylic character, this seemed as probable a course as any.
But it may have happened that τόν before ἊὙ. was lost, owing

to the same syllable concluding the preceding word στρατόν, and
that the >first line was, like many others in this melody, a cretio:

τόν Ἀγαμέμνονά τε λόγχαις [Ἄρειος]
Ἑλλάδι dds κλεινότατον στέφανον,
κλέος ἀείμνηστον, ἀμφιθεῖναι.

κλεινότατον στέφανον, in apposition to κλέος, may indeed cause
suspicion: a more probable word would have been κόλλιστον,
of which the other superlative might have been an interpretation:
but in cases like the present, the least possible alteration is the
most advisable.
