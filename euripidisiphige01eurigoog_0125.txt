Respecting this usage 01’οικεῖν οἶκον, see the note ol' Professor

Monk on Hipp.1014, likewise his observatione (Hipp. 1458) on
the future ἐάσομαι, the passive signification of which some anno-
111011 have not comprehended. 1 should have thought that there
was not to be found a verse in all the Tragedies lesa liable 10
suspicion than this; and was therefore not a little startled when Ι
perceivedthat Hermann had altered rt into οὗχι “’111ν,’ ει τον ἐμὸν
οἰκεῖν οἶκον οὐχ ἑάσομαι; which' rs less spirited, and contains,
besides, asolecirm, the Greeks would have said si μη ἐάσομαι.

v. 254. Aldus and the MSS. ἑκκεκόμψενσαι. πονηρόν γλῶσσ
Ιεἰ11φθουον σος11η,111111111111111111)1 corrupt. Ruhnken ad Timeri
11111155 restored 111 κεκομψευσαι. The compound verb ἐκ·
κομψεῦειν exists no where else, and ευ 11 requisito for the sense.
This however 11 not alli am persuaded that the poet wrote
11 κεκόμψευσαι πονηρά. Thus the meaning of Agamemnon rs

properly expressed, and m a manner agreeable to usage Compare
Hec. 1173. Kal μη livardus widuc 1υ λέγειν ποτέ. Hipp.

507. ταὶσγροῖ 1 ην λέγῃς καλῶς. Med. 582. Γλώσσῃ γαρ

αὐχῶν τοι ικ εὖ περιστελεῖν. Τολμᾷ πανουργεῖν. The order
of the following words rs, ’γλῶσσα σοφή ἐπίφθονον, lingua callida
odiorum ert. Hermann's edition adopts the reading of Musgrave,
Ευ κεκόμψευσαι. πονήρου γλῶσσ ἐπι φθόνον σοφη

ν. 255. I should prefer κου σαφης φίλοις.

ξελεγξαι μεν ξένους ουκ ἡξίουν. Angl. to expostulate 101111.

ν. 257. Aldus and the rest give ουτοι καταιυῶ λ1αν o ἑγῶε
nor do the MSS. differ, except that some omit σ’. That this

reading' rs corrupt, all must agree, but' 111 what way it ought to
be corrected, we cannot expect a coincidence of opinion. Mat·
’111111 prints in the text from conjecture κᾶνιῶ (for και (ινιῶ)
Hermann ουτε κατατενῶ >slav 1γι1. Β101111111ι1 ουτ συ σ.
ἐκτενῶ λίαν εγῶ. The suggestion which 1 have given in the
margin, 0111 αυ σ ἀλγυνῶ λίαν ε’γῶ, seems to be more pro·
bable. 111111111010111,1111111311 μητε in the preceding
line: αυ, on my port, perfectly suits the sense, and there' 11 no
term which Euripides was more likely to have uscd' 111 describing
