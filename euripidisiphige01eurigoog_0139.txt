108 Nouus ΟΝ ΤΗΕ

ιι trisyllable ιιι Orest v. 18, but lar more frequently a quadri-
syllable, nor is it ιο be believed that the poet would have used ιι in
the contracted form, where the common vocative Μενελαε suited
his verse. We may add, thatin the Troades, v. 896, there occurs
the same hemistich αίνῶ σε, Μενίλα.

ν. 430. irrideres, the error ol' the old editions, was corrected
by Barnes. ὄρθοιίι MS. Par. Musgrave proposed μετέθηκος. In
every copy of this play the following lines, which I have de-
graded from the text ιο the note, are attributed to Menelaus:

ταραχήγ ἀ6ελφῶν τις dl* sporo γίγνεται,

πλεονεξίαν τε 6οιμιίτων·’ animoso

τοιάνδε εσνὙΎὲνειαν ἀλλήλων πικράν.
Ιι was first noticed by Boeckh (De Trog3 (ἔται. p. 288) ιλιι
the whole rs an interpolation3 and Matthiae agrees with this opinion.
Hermann pronounces that the verses are not ιο be condemned,
but corrected, and given ιο Agamemnon A writer in the Classical
Journal& p. ..612 assigna them ιο the Chorus. Elmsley proposes
laal’* π ερωτα, Markland ολλήλοιν. But neither these, nor any
other changes can make it in the least more probable that such
verses were ever produced by Euripides. Not to mention that
γι is ιιι evident expletive, neither ταραχή nor πλεονεξία, as
Boeckh observes, can be found elsewhere in hia writings. Iwill
add that 1 do not believe either of these worda is used by any
other poet. Instead of ταραχή ιλιι word would have been τα·
paryuo'r But Ι do not believe that ιιι any writer whatever,
ταραχη α istoria could have been used for what this interpola-
tor designed, ιρις α 6ελφῶν. Neither' rs πλεονεξία 6ωμείτων a .
Greek expression. There are in these three lines several other
particulare which must offend all who are familiar with the Attio
Tragedians. And even if there were nothing faulty in the diction
and matre, yet the allusion made ιο the quarrel ol' Atreus and

Thyestes would be in this scene so unseemly and unnatural as to
throw suspicion on their genuineness. When these lines are re·

moved, the dialogue becomes smooth and unembarrassed.
