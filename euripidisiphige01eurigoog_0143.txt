aud MSS. μαινόμενε this being plainly corrupt, many are the

corrections hauarded by scholars, which we will pass in silence,
since Reiske has indisputably pointed out the true reading, porso-

μένων. The endeavours made aller other changes arose from an
ignorance of the laws of the verse. Markland proposes ἐντείνει
τᾶν Χαρίτων, buta passage of Athenaeus (xrrr. ..p .562. E.) cited
by Markland himself, contains a sufficient defense ol ἐντείνεται.

those who think that Athenaeus, from sailure of memory, attributed
to Chaeremon words which ,belong to Euripides.

ν. 473. ela 6e μοι μετρία μεν χάρις, Aldus. Ihave corrected
it, ε’ίη 6⁹ εμοί. Itis discussed by Matthia· and Hermann, whether
or not thrs passage rs referred to by Plutarch, p. ..132 Β. But that rs
a question with which the reader of this play rs hardly concerned.

v. 476. πολλάν τ 'Aldus and MSS. πολλάν 6 rs the emenda·

tion of Reiske.

v. 477. This Antistrophe contains a very large share of the
obscurity with which Euripides frequently chooses to invest the
chorio parts of his tragedias. The consequence is, that some cor-
ruptions bave been introduced by copyists, who did not perfectly
understand the words of the poet ,· and in order to remove those
corruptions, ιι number of conjectures have been hazarded‚ which
it would be neither instructive nor amusing to detail. Before Ι
explain the corrections made αι this edition, I will transcribe the
Antistrophe, as it stands rn the Aldine, with which I believe that all
