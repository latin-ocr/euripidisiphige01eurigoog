ἱακχοῖυ] Markland calls this chorus, onmium ia Euripide, mea
quidem opinione, pulcherrimam ct suavissimam, and laments that the
opening lines should be so defeced by corruptions3 one, however,
he produces himself, by writing τίν for ris. The factis that
he has taken a wrong view of the passage, thinking univeros to

be Deus Hymenaeus. AEmilius Portus had better comprehended rt:

he perceived that we must either read τίν υμένιιιου ...... ἔστασαν,
or τις υμέυαιος ...... εστασιν ἱαχοῖνς What ιυαι thot naptial sesag
thoe raised ita strains? Markland properly proposed' ιαιιχοῖυ for
ἱαχοῖυ, on account of the metre, as wellas κολοιμοεσσᾶυ sor κολο-
μόισσαν. Matthire retains the latter word3 but the reader will
observa that, as the two other instrumenta, the flate and the lyra,
which were the accompaniments of this song, have their respective
epitheta, the piper also are entitled to theirs‚· and his defense of
καλαμόισσοι ὶοιχιί fails, since ὶιιιιχᾶ applies not to the syrinx
only, but to the whole band. The first line is the only Choriambic
which 1 recollect in this play: it is however a measure somewhat
akin to the Glyconcus Polpseh. which abounds in this as well as the
three other chorusses, and which alwa s ends with a choriambus.

of the measure. l have changed it into ἐπὶ δαιτὶ, at the feast,
which is distinguished from dari doira, to the fluat, in v. 961.
The line thus becomes Glyo. Polysoh. like the antistrophic v. 965.
