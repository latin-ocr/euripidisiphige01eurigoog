180 Notus ΟΝ THE

, προθέμενος κτάνῃς τινᾶ;] All the copies have ἐὰν αὐτῶν,
which was certainly the reading of some one who thought that ·

an anaptest was as admissihle in the second foot of a Tragic aa
of a Comic senarius. Porson’s correction ὅτων ἂν cannot be right,
as it gives a sense foreign to the passage. 1 have adopted Elmsley's
(on OEd. T. 1460) ss the easiest and most probable, ‘lv' adron
Clytaemnestra means to say, Will any (ψ your children meet your
hats, thot you may treat ter as poa have treated Iphigenia? that is,

all your children mitt jly srorn your presence, sor sear tlrat poa
should putthen toa public death. Hermann gives in his text a
verse of his own, which it seems incredible that metrical ears could
have approved, [latior α’, ἐαν alro's cd προθέμενον strangu
Elmsley proposes προέμενος, as he avows, audacter. 1t strikes
me as not only unnecessary, but as less expressive than προθέ-
μενος, which implies exposure as a public victim.

v. 1009. Ταῦτ’ ἦλθον ἤδη dccl λόγων. ἦ σκῆπτρα od
Μόνον διαφέρειν, καῖ στρατηλατεῖν σε deit] τ. ἦ. η. d. λ.
Thur sar Ι have proceeded ia rnp argument. This is said ss pre-
paratory to a new topic. The phrase ἱέναι, ἐλθεῖν, μολεῖν ded
λόγων has usually a dative, and σοι is here understood. See the
note of Elmsley on Med. 842. Some MSS. have ἦλθεν, Hermann
ἦλθες. What follows has occasioned great perplexity, it having
been written ἢ σκῆπτροῖ σοι. Ι hope that 1 have removed the diffi-
culty by the smallest of all possible changes, adfer σοι. Barnes
has ἦ for ἦ. “σκῆπτρα διαφέρειν cum contemptu dicit, obambu-
lare oum sceptris significans, quo dignitas sua ab omnibus con-
spiciatur.'' Hermann. See v. 334. Σκήπτριρ νυν αι’ῖχει, ocia
κασίγνητον προδούς. The force of this passage is, What? haue
you no datiae to pepbrm eacepn to carry abeat your truncheon, and
to marshal the army? 1 doubt whether any edition before Her-
mann's has the interrogation.

v. 1090. dv χρῆν, for liv ypsi, is a necessary correction pro-
posed by Reiske3 quippe opportebat te justa oratione ati.

v. 1094. All editions have ἑν 'lap ’γαρ ἦν ro'd'3 I have
adopted Markland's suggestion ’γ’ ἂν ἦν, which seems to me, if
hot necessary, by far preferable; and no change was more likely
to have occurred in the MSS. ’γε is here very expressive: This
nocht ut any rote have been sair. Then l write nri α’ instead of
μή α’, and Hermann does the same. Here, as well as in the next

sentence, χρῆν is understood from v. 1091.
