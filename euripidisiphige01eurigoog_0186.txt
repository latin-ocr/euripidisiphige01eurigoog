unwanum nv nuum. 155

Mitt potissimam adducta est Clytaemnestra ιιι filiam morito daret. so
in matrimonium daret. The sense is illustrated by v. 100, and
various other passages of the Tragedy. All the editions which Ι
have seen, except Ηιιιτιιιιιιιιί,Ι give ἡ Κλ. ‹le' μοι, though the
pronoun is very emphatic.

v. 867. 'Elam τᾶν Ἕλλησιν] Aldus and the MSS. (cer-
tainly those which I have seen) have ἔδωκε’ τ’ ἄν. ilorci τ’ dv
was introduced by the second Hervagian Ed. and as the τ’ was
presumed to be τε, Barnea thought that he consulted the mesre by
printing τ’ ἄν ’γ’ Ἕλλ. Gaisford was the first who gave the
crusis τ’ dv, sc. τοι ἄν. .

v 869. Every edition h'as ἑστρατιυόμηι. But the tragic
usage prefers the active form στρατενειν. 1 have therefore not
hesitsted to give inoperationem, which was very likely, 1 had
almost said certain, to be changed by the transcribens into the
singular imponentium.

v. 870. 1. Νῦν cl οὐδέν’ ἱειμι, διιαραῖ ’γε τοῖς στρατηλάταις,
''Ev ενμαραι ds δρᾷν τε roi μη δρᾷν καλῶς] ln the second of
these lines l have given Blomfield’s reading εὐμαρεῖ δὲ instead of
canopei τε, as being better, though l confess not necessary There
are several versione of this line, and all· of them far removed from

the sense. It means merely this, Anu it ιι roilli them α motterrff
· indifference, whether Ι danefit themor not Compare Hel. 1243. Ἐν
ενμαρεῖ γοῦν σην κασιγνήτην θανεῖν. Hermann gives a new
character to the passage, thus, Ntvl ovcle'v' ειμι· παρα δὲ τοῖς
στρατηλάταις Ev’ conopes τα δρᾷν τε roi μη δρᾷι καλῶς·

ν. 872. 3. «t Trix'* euoenon oid ηρας, (iiv, πρὶν sir Φρύγας

dryas-ip ἐξαιρήσεται] The common reading ot* the second of
these verses is Ελθεῖν φόνον κηλῖσιν αἵματι χρανῶ, in which
both the matre and the syntax are indefensible. The comestion
which 1 have given is from Professor Porson (Troots, p. 224), and
though the change is slight, φόνον and αἵματος, 1 regard it as
one of the best emendations for which we are indebted to that
illustrious critic. It restores to Euripides avery spirited passage,
containing a happy reference to the Homeris mention of the Spear
of Achilles, which serves as a complete illustration of the meaning:
