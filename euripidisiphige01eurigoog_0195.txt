belongs to Tyrwhitt, who communicated this remark in conversa-·
tion to Musgrave, and pointed out the very words sung hythe
Thessalian maids‚ as they are marked with a dotted line in my
text. Hermann tries, but I think tries iu vain, to unssttle this
opinion of the passage, which has been held by scholare for the last
sixty years. He makes the words, μάντις o‘ Φοῖβος, ὁ Μουσᾶν
τ’ sidcis γεννάσει) Χείρων ε’ξονόμαξεν, part of the recited nup-
tial song3 and rendere Μονσᾶν sidcis γενιιάσεις, a Musis gene·¹
rationes edoctos. I¹ doubt however whether he will find the noun
γέννησις in any poet whatever 3 certainly notin a Tragedian.

v. 965. It used to be written παῖδες αἱ Θεσσαλα1, the article
having been inserted 1)] some one who thought he could dereby
make an agreement of measure with the Antistrophe. It was

properly erased by Heath.
v. 966. All the editions give Μάντις d Φοῖβος, the MSS.

μάντις (1.1 have inverted 11ιο words, and written Φοιβος o
μάντις, the order generally adopted m such a form ;-as Κάλχας
ο μάντις ν. 88 and 858. Πάρις ο βοάιιολος v. 176 O Φοιβός
θ’ o μάντις Iph T. 1128. Markland next alters μουσᾶν to
Μοιρᾶν, but without good cause. ὁμονσᾶν εἰδῶς’ rs not ο Μιιςί.)
edoctus, but literarum sciens, asin Hipp. 454. 61σ1ν ἐν μοάσαις
dei. ‘ysvudoess signifies paries.

v. 968. Vulgo ε’ξωνόμασεν. Ihave followed Markland in
writiug ἐξονόμασσεν, propter nestrum, though that word involves

a double licence But 1 should have done better had Ι given
ἐξονόμαζεν, as Ι conceive that the Poet has a direct view to the

expression so frequentin Homer, ἔπος τ εφατ’ ἔκ τ ὀνόμαζεν
L. Dindorf, ἑξονάμηνεν Hermann, ἑξονάμαξεν. Ι do not be·
lieve that either of those forms was used 1)] the Tragedians.

v. 970. In order to clear the construction, scomma may be
placed aster Πριάμοιο, or, if the reader prefers, after κλειναν.
’γαῖαν for πόλιν, asin v. 455. Ἀναρπάσονσι και κατασκάψουσι
γῆν. Respecting the use by the Tragedians of lonic genitives
in οιο, see Professor Monk's note on Alcest. 126. 1 do not think
him right however in giving A‘fdao in that line, and 1 prefer Her·
mann's reading Aila τε πυλῶνας.

v. 972. instead of περ1 σώματι Canter conj. περιζώματι.
But Markland pbserves that Euripides had a reference to Homer,
Ανταρ ἕποι’ ρ ἕσσαντο περ1 χρο1 νιάροπα χαλκόν.
