IPHIGENIA IN Auum. 87

wished to read στενόπορον, on account of the antistrophic v 185
fancying that the penultima ιιι νεοθαλεῖ was short. but' ιιι fact
it is the Doric form for νεοθηλεῖ.

ν. 165. All the editions have οἷ’γχῖαλων ν δᾶτων πρόφον.
1 have not hesitated to give ἀγχίαλον, since there ιι ιι manifest
adoption of the Homeric Epithet othalcis.Xah1clda'‘r ἀγχία-

served‚ whenever' ιι is found' 111 Tragedy,1s used as the epithet of a

Pers. 889 Some one wrote αγχιοὶλων upon metrical grounds, that
the antistrophic v. 186. might respond more exactly3 but m this too
he was mistaken, since ὁπλοφόρους Δαναῶν θέλονσ commences
not with a dactyl, but a tribrach. The verses are Glyconean, a
species which seldom begins with a dactyl; both ιιι the strophe
and antistrophe one long syllable' ιι resolved 1nto two short ones.

v. 167. Ἀχαιῶν στρατιᾶν ως κατι δοίμαν] commonly als
idom αν, which' rs not only a solecism but also destroys the metre.
Elmsley proposes ιιι ἐσιδοίμαν· but as 0110 MS hat ml 'idom
dv, Ι have preserred Hermann’s reading κατίδθῖμαν·

ν. 168 ΑΗ the copies have Ἀχαιῶν πε, which I have altered

into Ἀχαιῶν de, as in such a repetition δι’, not τε, ought always
to follow the word which rs repeated, unless there bea copulative
in the first as well as the second member of the sentence. Elmsley
has clearly explained this matter in his note on Soph.Aj.1050
(Mus. Crit. Ι. p. 474) Δοκονντ ε’μοῖ, δοκονντα d os κραίνει

στρατον Hermann's reading of α’ρῃων for Ἀχαιῶν, Which he
has inserted' ιιι the text, is, 1 think, very unfortunate. I would
have the reader observe that this and the two following verses
run on in continuous numbers, and would be more correctly in-
cluded in the same line, antispastio heptameter catalectio, if it were
possible for the page ιο admit one of such enormous length. This
monster-verse is an antispastio of the purest description, and has
such a correspondenoe with its antistrophic, that it is impracti·

cable to divide them into shorter lines without incisione in the
middle of ποι-(ιε’.
