tro change but that of προστάτην τε instead of προστάτην γε.
Matthiae has donc the same. Plutarch, who cites this in his Ni-
cias, p 526. Ο. gives προστάτην dd, and τάν ὄγκον for τάν
δῆμον, both which readings are adopted by Hermann ; the latter

by Matthiae.

· v. 377. Εἶεν· τί φήσω πρδς δάμαρτα τήν darive Πῶς
δέξομαί νινὶ ποῖον ὄμμα σνμβαλῶ;] εἷεν, Ιιαο missa faciamus,
a frequent exclamation, when the speaker turns to a new subject
Markland compares Plautus Asinar. v. 3. Quomodo sacam acorem
οκρὶοἱοιιι contra omelia? several MSS. have the subjunctive συμ-
βάλω but there seems ιιο necessity for disturbing the common
reading.

υ. 379. Kal ’γάρ μ’ daelhem, dari κακοῖς, ἅ μοι πάρα,
'Ertaia' ἄκλητος] This is the reading of Aldus; Markland
has intoduced πάρος for πάρα from some MSS. But the common
reading is unesceptionable; so in Orest. 704. τῶν κακῶν, d σοι,
πάρα. And to say the truth, Markland did not clearly appre-
hend the meaning of the passage, when hc translated it, prater
molo quc habai prius, veniens ιιοιι vocato. ἐπὶ κακοῖς is not ·
derideatis aa, but omidst the illa. The opinion of Hermann is
more probable, that πάρος was the arguta correctio of some Gram-

marran.
v. 381. νυμφεύσουσα for ννμφεύονσα is the correction of

Markland, on account of δώσουσα which follows= in ν. 787 the
same participle is ¹applied to the same person, aud to the same
transaction.

υ. 383. Tria δ’ mi τάλαιναν παρθένον] Commonly τήνδ’.
This was corrected by Matthia.

v. 384. Aidns νιυ, ὥς doras, νυμφεύσει τάχα] This con-
ceit respecting virgins on the point of death, seems to be a
great favourite with Tragedians. Euripides in Orest 1107. Alina

also our own Shakcspear, Rotam aad razio. Act ιν. sc. 5. and

Aac. 3883 οἶμαι *γάρ νιν ἱκετεύσειν τάδε] The reading of

the copies is ἱκετεῦσαι, which Markland and soma other editors
atrise in vain to defend. There follows in v. 388. ἀναβοήσεται.
