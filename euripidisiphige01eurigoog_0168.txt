IPHIGHNIA IN AULIS. 137

Nor do the MSS. differ, except that the two Parisian have ἔτυχεν
Λήδα. Markland observes that we ought to read θρνιθι πταμένῳ.
Porson (on Med. l) says that ἰ’πταμαι in the present was unknown
to the Attics. ln other points the critica have not been successful.
For ὦς ἔτυχε Musgrave wished to read ὥς σ’ ἔτεκε, in which
Elmsley and Hermann concur. But it could hardly be said that Leda
was reported to have given birth to Helen ot tlre time when Jupiter
was transformed into a swan. ln the next place, the last vowel of
Λήδα can neither be cut off, nor can it be left open before ὄρνιθι.
ln order to remedy the defeat, Scaliger (on Catull. p. 51. ed. 1607.)
proposed to insert 'styria' δρα, and Po'rson μιχθεῖσ’. Ι do not ι
like either of these words ; but still there is an evident hiatus in the
verse, and something seems to be required to suit the sense. Be·
aides‚ one of the Paris MSS. which Ἰ have collated, presents the
passage thus, ἔτυχεν Λήδα ὄρνιθ’ ἱπταμένῳ, leaving an
interval suited to a word of two syllables. lt seems therefore not
improbable that the participle πλαθεῖσ’ once stood in the text. lt
occurs in a similar usage in Andr. 25. Πλαθεῖσ’ Ἀχιλλέως παιδὶ,
δεσπότῃ δ dorp, as well as elsewhere in our Author. ln what fol·
lows, I have restored the augment of ἠλλάχθη, and have given
δέλτοισι Πιερίσιν on account of the metre. Hermann writes
ἐτήτυμος for ἔτυμος, and expunges the word Λήδα altogether.
He says that the former is required by the metre; but' on this head
1 must be allowed to differ from him: the verse ei δή φάτις
ἔτυμος ὠς, which may be called Glyconeas acephalas, occurs not
unfrequently in this play and in other parts of Euripides.

v. 702. ἄλλως is applied inasimllar way in Hipp. 197. Μή-
θοις δ ἄλλως φερόμεσθα. Hec. 487.

v. 703. Ποῦ τῶν Ἀχαιῶν ἐνθάδ’ ὁ στρατηλάτήςς] The
common arrangement of the words would be τῶν ἐνθάδε Ἀχαιῶν.

ν. 706. Οὐκ ἑξ ἰ’σον ’γὰρ μένομεν Εὐρίπου πέλας] πέλας
ia an emendation in the margin of Barnes' text, for πύλας. This
is a very simple and, Ι think, satisfactory way of removing an un-
questlonable fault. The meaning is, We, ινΙιο οοινροιι the army
nom hasting acar the Euripus, ανι aot aa ander the rame circam-
stances. Achillea then proceeds to explain what is the dissimilarity

to which he alludes. Professor Hermann however, has taken a very '

different view of the passage. He observes that v. 715, as it stands

in the manuscripts, concludes with Εὐρίπου πνοαῖς, and accord·
