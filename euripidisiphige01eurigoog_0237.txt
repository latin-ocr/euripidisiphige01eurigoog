necessary to adapt it to the occasion, That this line wa's intrusiv'e
was pointed out first, Ι believe, by Burges, in Closs. douravol. 1.
p. 613. who remarked that it destroyed the regularity of the στι-·
χομυθῖα, or dialogue in alternate verses. This cause would not
have been sufficient by itself sor its ejection‚ as there are some
instances, though few, of such a deviation from the general rule:
but when added to the other considerations, it leaves little doubt
as to its condemnation. In this opinion 1 am happy t'o say that
Hermann concurs. He however, changes μήτ οὐν into μή μοι,
as I think, very erroneously. Iphigenia, referring to 1111 two
outward signs of mourning practised among the Greeks, intends
to heg Clytaemnestra neither to cut off her hair, nor to put on
black clothes3 but no sooner has she named the first particular,
than she is interrupted by the impatient mother, whose attachment
to the fashions of her country is displayed in her momenta of
affliction aa strongly as at the period of her fancied happiness.

v. 1818. This was formerly written, Τι’ δῆτα add εἶπας, ὦ
τέκνον, ἀπολέσασά σε; a verse with two anapaests: one was re·
moved by Barnes' correction 66, the other by Markland's erasure
0116. But though dr} for δῆτα is adopted by Porson‚ Elmsley,
Matthiae, and Hermann, Ifeel convinced that the right particle in
this line is ποτε, for which δῆτα was erroneously substituted here
as well as in v. 238.

v. 1319. All copies have Οὑ ori ys, and no cavil has yet been
heard. But surely ys is out of place. The true reading is ori
ov' με, scil. ἀπώλεσας.

v. 1333. In the editions it stands thus, Ti ‹lal ‘ro' θνήσκειν, ori
τάφος νομίζεταις except in Gaisford's, who writes both here and
in v. 1326. dri for dni, (which last was not used by the Tragedi-

ans; see Brunck and Porson on Med. 1008) but adds, “Sed hic
locus graviori vulnere adhnc fortasse laborat.” Nothing to be
sure can be more senseless than the common translation, Quid

¹ oe‚ro aa non ipsa mors existimatur sepultura? But rt does not ap-

pear that any other correction is necessary, than that thch Ι have
given by placing an interr after θνήσκειν; why, what than as death?
I should have preferred ri γαρ το Θνήσκεινς The Poet hadu his
eye on Homer ll. H. 456. ΙἜνθα ε ταρχυσουσι κασίγνητοί τε orm
