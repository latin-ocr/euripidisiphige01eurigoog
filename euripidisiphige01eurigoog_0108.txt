IPHIGENIA IN sums. 77

not hesitated to substitute πέρα, agreeably to common usage.
Professor Dobree (Advers. Vol. ιι. p. .88) testifies that this was the

reading of Porson.
v. 45. Σῆ ’γάρμ α’λόχιρ τότε Τνν6άρεως Πέμπει φερνήν,

Ξννννμφοκόμον πε lucana] τότε is not unfrequently used' ιιι
reference to a time which 1simp1ied but uotexpressed; asin
Orest. 99. Alc. 938. Here the words φερνὴν and ξυνν. plainly
imply that the time was that of the King's wedding There' ιε there-

fore not the slightest reason for me correction given in Barpes’ mar·
gin, ποτε. Ιιιν. 771 the same old servant says, Χι6τι μ έν ταῖς

σοῖσι φερναῖς ἔλαβεν Ἀγαμέμνων 6ναξ.Α1ιιιοει all editions
give πέμπεν, which, besides the rejection of the augment, is not
a proper substitute for ἔπεμψε. Therefore I have had no hesita„
tion in printing πέμπει, the emendation of Porson and of Ehnsley.
Hermann ιε displeased with diacrov as being too arrogant an epitbet
for the speaker to apply to himself; and has accordingly printed
πέμπειν and 6ικαιοι, a change which l cannot help regarding as the
reverse of an improvement. This characteris represented as being
loquacious, and aelf-important, and as using the privileges of an old
and confidential domestic. Moreover, dirutos is a very appropriate
word, signifying disinterested, the reverse of κερ66λεος, as in v. 935.
See the note of )Elmsley on Med. 86. (Oi μὲν harcies, oi 66 καὶ

ποθ’. ] Matthiae has adopted m his text the conjecture of Mark-
land φθόνοι instead of φόνος, a change which weakens me force
of the passage. Hermann properly regards οἱπειλαι καὶ φόνος

asalegitimate instance of the figure εν Sal 6νοῖν·’ “Habet ista

, figura locum ιιι iis, quae et conjuncta et disjuncta cogitari possunt,

non in illis, quae disjuncta absurda sunt”

v. 54. Τ6 septasol* οπόροις εἶχε Τνν6οἶρεῳ πατρὶ, Δοῦναί
πε μη 6οῦναί πε, πῆε τύχης 6πιος ‘liubana’ ἄριστα] Markland
cites a passage from the Supplices of AEschylus v. δ384. of which
the present seems to be an imitation: Ἀμηχαν66 ε, και φόβοι
μ έχει φρένας, Δρᾶσαί τε μη 6ρᾶσαί τε, rol τύχην ἑλεῖν.
hence he conjectures that we should read' ιιι Euripides τῆς
