Ἣ χρνσδν φίλου ἆνδρδς ἐδέξατο τιμήεντα. Ροιιοι translates
eorrectly, ιο repay The carffal nurture which le gave my youth?

v. 1138. 9. It was written ιιῆ πρός ’γε Πέλοπος, before
Markland, he gave πρός σε Π. as well as τῆσδε for τῆς ’γε
along with some MSS. I do not recolleot any other instance of
ιιίδίνειυ governing an accusative. ·

v 1131. 2. Ti μοι μέτεστι τῶν Ἀλεξάνδρου’ yergua, Ελένης
τε; πόθεν ἦλθ’ επ ὀλέθρῳ τώμῷ, πέπερι] There hasbeen
a very needless attempt to disturb the second of these lines.
Markland would read Ἑλένη πε πόθεν ἦλθ’ ...... ; a strange
misapprehensiou. Matthia says Hic versae mili valde otiosa nide-
tvr. But Hermann justly observes that, if it were taken away,
the mention of Paris would he an unmeaning interruption to the
line of argument. He properly explains it, Car, qaod ille Spartam
verrit, milvi est pereundam?

v. 1134. ‘lv’ ἀλλὰ τοῦτο καπθανοῦσ’ έχω σέθεν Μνημεῖον]
Barnes would place a comma aster ἵν’, and alter the order of
construction on account of the unusual position of ἀλλά. But that
adverb is properly rendered in Portus’ version saltem. See a
note of Professor Monk in Mus. erit. 1. p. 206.

v. 1135. It is commonly read ei μὴ τοῖς ἐμοῖς πεισθῇς λόγοις.
To remove this union of εί with a subjunctive, Porson gave ei
μή ...... πείθει, Elmsley πείσει. But ιι εεειιιε far more likely that
ἢν should have been changed into εἱ, than πεισθῇς ἱιιιο πείθει
οι· πείσει. I adopt therefore ην with Matthiae, who observes,“ el

has subsequently altered his opinion, and now upholds ει πεισθῇς.

ν. 1137. Aldus gives this line, ‘'eOnwcd εσυν δοίκρνσιυ’ areant

to the great offense of all metrical ears. Itis not impossible that
amid a hundred conjectures the right reading might have been
hit upon; but fortunately' ιι hasbeen preserved hy the manuscripts,
