lPHlGENlA IN AULlS. · 193

tngly corrected the passage to Auenticum ονομα μεν φέροντ’,

ἑμοὶδε θανοτυν, ω κόραιτ iuthat casewe ought toread φέρουσαν.

But consideration will, Ithink, convince me reader, that 1 have
done right' m rejecting the line altogether. lt would' rmpair the
pathos of her lamentatione, were Iphigenia here to ellege that
‘her 'death was bringing fame to the Greeks! The display of
her patriotiem is reserved for the following seene3 she is now
altogether occupied with bewailing her own hard fate· nor am l
satisfied that, had any such meaning been intended hythe Poet‚
the hare word ονομα would heve been used to express τιμην οι·
xhe'oc.Neither'1s it conceivable that Iphigenia would at this
moment have inserted an appeel to the Chalcidians, to whom she
says nothing else. l have therefore altered ω κοραι into ol κόρα,
as being the words of the Chorus. Elrnsley gives the two next
lines to the Prinoess‚ and writes reingerio προθυματ challen-

heis followedby Monk and Hermann, the former giving ἔλαβέ
μ, the latter ov ὠ κοραι, προθυματ ελαβεν. But 1 per-

ceive nothing which makes the interposition of the Chorus at' thia
moment either improper or unusual: the old editions have confined

their words within the limite of a senarian iambis, ¹believing that ·

au interruption from the Orchestra ought always to be in ‚that
measure ; hut e reference to vv. 1376, &c will shew that similar
interlocutory remarks are sometimes made in the same ,kind of verse
. as that used by the ector. ¹

v. 1204. Πικρᾶν ἰδοῦσα δυσελέναν] l feel great suspicion of
the word ἰδοῦσα, which seems to be unmeaning, and to wealten an
affecting sentence. Why should she at this moment observe that she
had behold Helen? Ι do not venture to propose any emendation,
but will suggest the manner in which rt is possible that the present
reading might3 have ρδθυο caused Let us imagine thet such a line

νιε[ἁραῖς drl]r ονσα δυσελέναν stood rn the text, and thet the
bracketted letters were obliterated by damp or some other cause
(un accident which certainly has befallen another part of thia song):
a metrieal corrector was likely to supply the chasm, by repeating
πνκροὶν from the preceding line. Helen rs called by Euripides
Δυσολὲνα also 111 Orest. 1384. the term being probably suggested
by Homer’s designation of her paramur, Δυσπαρι, Il. Γ. 39

, v. 1208. Every edition has ud Αυλις. Ihave erased allas

en insertion made for the purpose of producing a dimeter
