IPHIGENIA IN AULIS. 207

common reading3 κεῖνας is my emendation, ἑξόψης Reiske's Not
only' rs an accusative with αμφ1 more usual m this sense, but Ι
think 1t may be concluded that such was the reading of the older
copies of Euripides, from which the interpolator compiled the line
after 1317. Had he found κείναις here, he would have there written
σιόματι instead of σῶμα. Upon the other variation Hermann says,
“Libri ἐξάψῃ. Reiskium ἑξόψῃς corrigentem secuti sunt Gais-
fordius aliique, non memores medii eam vim esse, ut significet ne
ι’ἰὶας quidem jubeas atras vester induere? I must demur to this

doctrine: the active is both simpler and more agreeable to usage.
v. 1328. 'snos τ1 vulgo. επος τι ed. H. Steph.

v. 1329. All edd. have Ορέστην’ τ. But as a new topicis
started, Ορεστην δ appears to be necessary.

v 1333. Πατέρα 'ys τόν ε’μόν μὴ στύγει, πόσιν τε σόν]
In Ald. and MSS. πατέρα τόν ἐμόν. Scaliger proposed πατερα
τόν αμόν. Barnes gave πατέρα ‘ys τόν ἐμόν Markland and
Elmsley follow the critic of great name,· Musgrave and Mat-
thlae adopt Barnes' reading, which rs confirmed by the greater·
part 01 the MSS. ys has the force common in dialogues, ρας.
Hermann, πατέρα τε. 11 there were any reason for deviating
from the authority of MSS. should prefer πατέρα σ11τ.ἑ.μ
σ. πόσιν δὲ’ σον. See note on v. 1049.

ν.1334. Δεινοῦς ἀγῶνας δια σε δει κεῖνον δραμεῖν] Thiara
a correction by Porson (Proef. Hec. p. xxxv.) for κεῖνον δεῖ δραμεῖν,
whieh' 1s opposed to his canon regarding the fifth foot of the se-
narius. Compare Orest 868. αςγιῖννα θανασίμον δραμούμενον.
Bacch 962. Τονγαρ σ αγῶνες ἀναμένουσιν οὓς ἐχρῆν.

v. 1336. Adhrpd'z’ αγεννιὸς, Ἀτρέως τ οὐκ ᾰξ1ως]“ ‘Elmsleius
ldlpyss’ αςρεννῶς τ, 'Arps'wr’ τ οὐκ α’ξίως. Non recte Nam
sensus est, όκων με’ν, δόλῳ δέ.” Hermann.

v. 1337. Τ1ς μ εἶσιν ἄξων, πρ1ν σπαρόσσεσθαι’ κομης ;]
commonly σπαράξεσθαι. Elmsley remarked that the fut. inf. alter
πρ1ν is a solecism, and that σπαράσσεσθαι rs required. The two
Flor. MSS. have κόμης, which Hermann adopts: at this 1 am
surprised. Iphigenia might have said πρ1νμ’ἀποσπᾶσθαι’κομης,
hffore I om dragged away *by my hair, or ἄγεσθαι κόμης, as ἄξει
ἑθείρης 111 v. 1252. but πρ1ν σπαράσσεσθαι κόμας has a different
meaning, defore I have my hair toro.

v. 1388. E‘yw‘ye μετα ool-ld) μη ov'vy'* ov καλῶς λέγεις]
