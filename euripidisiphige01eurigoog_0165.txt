134 NOTES ΟΝ ΤΗΕ

and one would have expected Ιλιου ds, εΦρυγῶν πόλιν, rather
than Πέργαμον, the candel of Troy. There must be something
wrong in the passage, unless we ean feel satisiied with finding
κυκλώσας πόλιν and πέρσας πόλιν so close together. On the
other hand Φρυγῶυ” epona might be used with the greatest
propriety, as ερυμα Aodias' ιιι Bacch. 55, οι spana Τρώων, Soph.

Α] 467. lwill frankly acknowledge that the appearance of the word
ςρυμα in all the copies in v. 698. where it is an unmeaning in-

truder, has made me wish that it could change 1ts position to the
first line. 1 think that the reader of Euripides would rejoice if
some old copy were discovereds m which the linea of the chorus
were found written κιονηδδν, in columns, (a common practice in
MSS.) so that the two lines 678 and 693 met together ιιι the fol·-
lowing manner,
Πὲργαμον le* Φρυγῶν ἔρυμα δακρυόεν τανύσας πατρίδος

In this case, a transcriber might by mistake attach the last word

of one line to the beginning of the other. If we imagine such an
accident as this to have happened, there ean hardly‘be a doubt
but that a subsequent corrector of the text would fill up the chasm
in the first line so as to produce a common Glyconean‚ and thus
we may account for the word πόλιν, which we should be glad to

discard: there are instances of Glyconeans having the last syllable
resolved in vv. 176. 498. 693. 955.

v. 680. All the copies give κυκλώσας Ἄρει φοινίῳ. Various
are the attempta which have been made at emendation: but as Ἄρει
is palpably corrupt (since no writer could say Αρης κυκλώσας Ἄρει)
1 Ihave adopted the correctron of Hermann, δορὶ, which rs rendered
extremely probable by the Ionic form of φοινίῳ, which seems to
prove that the preceding word must have consisted of two short syl·

lables. The reader will notice in this passage an instance os pertici
ples following one another withoutaconJunctron κυκλώσας, σπάσας,

πέρσας, a mode of construction frequentin the Greek writers.
See vv. 79 707 These participles all refer to ‘'quc ιιι ν. 669.

v. 681 Λαιμοτώμους reponderatione] The old editions have
intaminata. Itis corrected by Markland from the MSS. How-
ever, Hermann has brought back the other which ldo not remember
to beelsewhere used by the Tragediana. λαιμόπομος has a passive
sense in Hec 007. Ιοιι. 1054. There exista a different form, λαιμό-
Ῑτμητος, in Phoen. 465.
