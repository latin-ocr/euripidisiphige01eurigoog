rustes some repentanoe 101· having so done. 11011ναί τε μὴ δοῦναί τε

(I meon, whether 10 give der away οι· not) 1s an instance, very
common in the Tragedies, 01 infinitives which are independens of
the construction 01 the rest of the sentences besides, τάχη and

ἡτῦχη bave different meanings; the former denotas fortune, or
chonoe; the latrantis event But there has been a still more
improbable conjecture haaarded 011 this passage. There rs found
in Hesychius άθρανστα, απρόσκοπα Ε1ρ1π11 ης 1φιὙινε1ᾳ εν
Αν’λ1δι. As the word άθραυστα rs nowhere met within the

play, it occurred to Hemsterhuis that' 11 might be substituted for
ἄριστα in this passage3 a conjecture which, with all reverenoe
for his great name, Imust regard as most unfortunate. The word
might have existed 111 some part 01 the Tragedy now lost; but
the words τῆς τύχης ὅπως ‘bibuef‘ αριστα, how Ιιι might bert·
deal 1111111111 incident, are liable to no suspicion. Hom. 11 Γ. 110.
ὅπως ὄχ’ ἄριστα μετ ἀμφοτέροισι γένηται.

v. 59. Σπονδάς καθεῖναι] Compare Helen. 1235. Σπονδάς
τέμωμεν, και διαλλάχθητί μοι. Should we not there read καθῶμεν

101 reincensa?

v. 61. The early Editions have Τούτῳ οσνναμάνειν εἴτις εκ
δόμων λαβο1ν Ο1χοιτο, τόν τ ἔχοντ άπάσασθαι λέχους,
Κάπιστματεόειν, κα1 κατασκάπτειν πόλιν. Heath removed the
anapaest iu the first of these lines, by restoring the future, the re·
tention 01 which tense is as necessary 101 the syntax as 101 the metre3
and Markland pointed out the emendations necessary in the rest 01
the passage. Most, 111101 all the MSS. have α’πωθοίη. Ithink
therefore that ἆπιόσασθαι was introduced hythe Aldine editor,
who mistook the meaning 01 the passage, and imagined τόν εχοντα
10 imply the ravisher, instead 01 the husband. The words roi
κατασκάπτειν πόλιν are to be considered as iu a parenthesis,

as far as the construction is concerned.
