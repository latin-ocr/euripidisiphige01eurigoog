ingly propounds the following hypothesis: that the Poet gave at the
end of 706, Εὐρίπου πνοᾶςς and at the end of 715, Εὐρίπου
ninas: but that a transcribet, suffering his eye to wander from
the final word of one of these lines to that of the other, reversed
the places of the substantivas ; and at the same time committed a
secundary error by writing πυ’λας and πνοαῖς instead of nuituis
and πυοιίς. Acting upon this theory, Hermann prints the line thus,
Oh< ἐξ ’ίσου ’γὀίρ μένομεν Εὐρίπου πυοάς; For ore we not att
in tlte same condition, waiting jor the winda which ατε to carry ns out
of the Euripus? This conjecture is truly ingenious and acute: but
whether it be entitled to an'y degree os confidence, the reader must
determine. Ι confess that to my mind it does not carry conviction‚
but rather seems a needless attempt to temper with a plain and un·
suspected passage.

v. 709. Θάσσουσ’ ἐπ’ ἀκταῖς· oi δ’ ἔχοντες εὗυίδας Καί
παῖδας] The copies have ἐπ’ α’κτοίς, which Markland alters to
ἐπ’ οἷκταῖς, in littore, as in Hec. 36. where the same words
θ. s’. oi. occur. Then, καί παῖδας is the reading of Musgrave
for the common one ἄπαιδες. Both these corrections seem to be
indispensable; they are adopted by· Hermann, but not by Matthiae.

v. 710. οὕτω δεινος ἐμπέπτωκ’ ἔρως Tinde στρατείας
Ἑλλάδ’, οὑκ ἄνευ θεῶν] All the authorities have Ἑλλάδι ’γ’
with an anapaest in the fourth foot. Porson (Suppl. Praef. Hec. p. 22.)
corrects it by the erasure of the γ’, adding, “ Nagna- de elisione in
Ἑλλάδι, quanquam paullo rarior est, timendum.” The same emend-
ation had been made by Scaliger. Elmsley however questions the
legitimacy of an elision in the dative singular, and alters nine lines
of the Tragedies in which it occurs. Had the entire plays of
AEschylus, Sophocles and Euripides survived, he would, perhaps,
have had ten times as many instances of the same elision, on which
to exercise his emendatory skill. His first idea had been that
Ἑλλάδ’ was an accusative: (See Addenda ad Heroni. 693) but as
ἐμπίπτειν in all other places but one (and that doubtful) governs
a dative, he formed a different opinion when editing the Medea,
and suggested (Note on v. 93) to omit Ἑλλάδ’ altogether, and to
supply the verse by reading oin ἄνευ θεῶν τινος. This suggestion,
though given without confidemus, Hermann not only approves, but
admits into his text. Matthia retains Ἐλλάδι ’γ’ and the anapoest.
'l'he particle ‘y' was the universal panacea of ancient meniual
correctori, when they wanted to prevent a hiatus. There seems
