Elmsley on Med. 1103. Λέξον δέ πῶς ὤλοντο. Compare Soph.
Aj. 1261. Οστις τρός ημᾶς duri σου λέξει τα cci

v. 1064. 5. Ελένην Μενέλεως” ινα deific—rabdo* ’γε voi
Κοκῆς 7vvcsrdv μισθόν’ σποτῖσαι τέκνα] All editions have
Ελένην Μενέλαος-Ι prefer Μενέλεως, as does Dobree.
Elmsley (Edinb. Rev. Vol. mx. p. 69) gives Μενέλαος Ι.Ελένην
Then Aldus and the MSS. read καλόι ιγένος, a palpable corrup·
tion: but' ιιι the second Hcrvagian Ed. and that of Brubach rs
καλόν 7e νῴ, which, whether it proceeded from manuscript au-

thority or not, I believe to be the true reading, or nearly so·
perhaps some may give the preference to the dative νῷν, as in
Med 514. Καλόν 7 ονειδος erupi νιωστ1·νομφι’ῳ Πτωχοῦς
α’λᾶσθοι παῖδας The ironical use 01καλοί 7e has been re-
marked on v. 683. The meaning is, It' ιι a pretty thing to be eure
thot you aad Ι should puy our children'e lives ar the price «ff ο bod
ινοιιισιι. Elmsley has a different emendation, highly praised by
Matthiae, rohdv7 έθος, and Hermann καλὸν κλέος· both seem
to enfeeble the sentence, and the letter loses the particle which' rs
highly significant. It was formerly edited deroricar: Elmsley
corrected the accent.

v. 1066. Τθχθιστα τοῖσι φιλτάτοις ὠνούμεθα] The first
'word in this line wes corruptly written in Aldus and the Paris
MSS. ταχθεῖσα. This soon deviated still further from the
truth3 τ ἀχθέντα Herv. 2, τ ἀχθεινᾶ Η. Steph. Brodaeus rc-
storcd ταχθιστα. Instead of τοισι Hermann grvep τοι τοῖς.

v. 1067. commonly ἢν στρατεύσῃ and κάκεῖ γονήση. But as
the latter murt be a future (Attic γενήσει) the subj. being
’γένωμαι not γενήσομαι, Elmsley gives ei στρατεύσοι. Itmay
be a question whether it should be στρατεύσας or στρατεύσοι.

v. 1070. Alcest 966. Γνναικός enode σιντ dv eicideo κενὰς,
Θρόνοος τ, έν οισιν ἷζε.

v. 1072. The Edd. and MSS. have κάθημαι, which Elmsley
alterato κοθῶμαιτ Hermann follows him, and, aster some hesi-

tation, I have done the same. There' rs no doubt but that, if the
sentence 1s ιο proceed m regular syntax, a subjunctive rs re-
quisite after οταν But the Tragedians sometimes change the

construction for greater effect; and Matthiae argues that on thie
ground «donnatis right Hermann however remarks that ιιι

such changes of mood, the tense' rs always that which the meaning
