of his genius. 'lhe external evidences in its favour are amose as
complete as could be hoped for in such a matter. We find no
quotation from or allusion to any former pisce on the same subject,
which our Tragedy is supposed to have superseded: many passages
of the existing play are recognised and quoted by a succession of
Greek writers from Aristotle down to Stobaeus3 and it is proved
by numerous fragments which have been preserved from a Latin
Tragedy of the Iphigenia in Aulis, that ours is the productiori
which was communicated to the Romans in a free paraphrase by
Ennius.

In the course of my critical examination of the text, 1 fancied
that 1 discovered the causes which had led to such strange suspicions
respecting this play, and had prevented its being as generally read
and admired as it deserves. F irst, the perverse industry of an
interpolator, who, with an imperfect knowledge of the langnage
and rhythm of Tragedy, and an almost incredible want of teste,
has introduced much flat and lifeless matter of his own in various
parts of this noble piece. Secondly, besides the usual sources
of corruption to which the remains of the ancients have been
exposed, many of its verses have experienced deliberate alteration
by some person (perhaps the same to whom the interpolations are
due) with the apparent object of removing constructione and ex-
pressions which he did not comprehehd,

For the restoration of such passages, we have very scanty assist-
ance from manuscript authorities. I am not aware of the existence
os more than four MSS. of the Iphigenia in Aulis: two at Paris,
and two at Florence: each of those libraries contains also the collation
Â¹of a third MS. But since these six authorities concur for the most
part with one another, and with the Princeps edition of Aldus, it
is plain that they all derive their origin from the same copy, and
that one of no great antiquity. In most of the corrupt passages,
and in those which are evidently interpolated, the readings oi the
Aldine and the manuscripts agree with surprising uniformity. lt
appears therefore that the two great injurias which the text has sus-
tained, had been inflicted previously to the manscription of the parent
copy. In a few cases, indeed, the true reading has been fortunately

preserved by Greek authors who have quoted the passages: two
instances of this 1 will here mention, as they may serve to explain
the peculiar sort oi corruption which our Tragedy has experi-
enced:
