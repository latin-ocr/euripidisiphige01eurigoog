surely have the same sense as ὤφελες μήτε μολεῖν, μήτε πρα-

would he properly applied m a sentence of that description.

v. 495. The common reading re Βάρβαρο συρίζων Φρυγίων
Αὐλῶν Ολιίμπου καλάμοις Μιμήμαπα πλέκων. Instead of

πλέκων the Paris MSS. have πνέων. Olympus was the name of ·

a celebrated musician either of Phrygia or Mysia, the scholar of
Marsyas: his farne rs recorded by many ancient writers, who are
cited by Brodaeus and others: reference rs particularly made to
Plato, p. 144. G. andp. 567. C. Aristoph. Eq 9 Ovid Met. ιι. 392.
Speaking of Marsyas, Ovid says, illurn ruricolae, sylvarum numina,
Fauni,...et tanc qaoque clarus Olympus, et Nymphae fleant. Some
light is thrown upon this part of the Epode by Telestes, a poet
quoted rn Athenaeus xrv. p 617 B whose imitation of Euripides
has been pointed out by Huschke, Epist. Cr p. 147. The following
are his verses, partly corrected by Hermann. H Φρνίγα καλ·

λνπνόων αυλων ιερῶν βασιλῆα, Avida ος ἥρμοσε πρῶτος

Aoipador ἀνρίίπαλον μουσης νόμον αίολόμορφον, Πνενμαπος .

είίππερον αυραν Ἁμφιπλέκων καλάμοις. From this imitation
we have a satisfactory defence of the participle πλέκων. It seems
also very probable that Euripides wrote Φρυγίων αυλῶν dvri-
παλον πνοᾶν (as given in the margin) and that μιμήματα was
nothing more than an explanation of that expression, which crept
into the text to the expulsion of the words of the Post. Hermann
also is of opinion that μιμήματα was a mere interpretation: it seems
strange therefore that he should print in his text μιμηλά. In regard
to this usage of πλέκειν, we may compare Pindar‚ Ol. v1. 147.
dvdpo'otv' αιχμαπαισι πλέκων northon* υμνου. There rs an ex·
pression very similar to ίλο present in the Bacche v. 1270 ἁδυβόᾳ

Φρυγίων ανλων πνεύματι.

v. 498. Ευθηλοικί ἐτρέφοντο βόες, Ὅτε σε κρίσις έμενον
θνᾶν].Ι suspect that these two linas have been removed from Ι
their proper place, and thet they ought to follow v. 494. eidnhos

πόριν. Hermann has introduced ἔμηνε, instead of dusera, with
ryhich 1 see no reason to quarrel. There rben follows a verse,
ἄ ο 'mdia' πέμπει, which 1 have taken out of the text, as the

od'spring of the interpolator, who wished, as it would appear,
to maneat the preceding lines with those that follow, and was
