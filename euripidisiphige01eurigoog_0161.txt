v. 685. Ti χρῆμιας πείθεσθαι γᾶρ ειθισμαι σέθεν] So
Aldus apd the other editors. llour or more of the MSS. have
εἴθισμΗ εκ σέθεν, which Markland has adopted. But· since a diph-
thong cannot be cut off, Porson pronounces the true reading to be
εἴθισμαι ’·κ σέθεν, and compares Soph. El. 409. Ἐκ τοῦ, φίλων
πεισθεῖσα; but 1 doubt whether such a erasis or ecthlipsis was
admissible in Tragedy: besides, it does not seem clear that this
would be a proper answer to the words of Agamemnon, πιθοῦ ds'
μοι. Ι cannot therefore acquiesce in the reading of Porson. Mat-
thiae in (iram. Gr. 840 contende that πείθεσθαί τινος may be used
for πείθεσθαὶ τινι, and Hermann agrees with him 3 but this has
not been proved by examples from Attic writers. It seems to me
that this line is so corrupted, that rt is hopeless to recover with any
certainty the words of Euripides. 'l'o say the truth, lbelieve that
πείθεσθαι ’γὰρ εἴθισμαι was an interlineal interpretation, which
happened by accident to square with the metre, and was thence
admitted into the text, from which it expelled the words of the
poet. About the meaning there is no doubt3 but what were the
' exact words, in which Clytaemnestra expressed her mind, the reader
must be left to surmise. Let us, for instance, suppose that there
was found in the ancient copies such a verse as that which 1 have
interlined, ‘ri χρῆμ’; ἐπείσθην καὶ πάρος λόγοις σέθεντ an in-
terpreter might have written over them, as an explanation, πιθέσθαι
‘yolp aldionas, which being taken as a various reading, would, with
a very slight change, bave formed the verse in the text.

v 637. Mmpdc τί χωρὶς θράσεθ, ων με θρᾷν χρεών ;]
commonly μητρός rt: 1 have edited τι 'with Matthiae and Her-
mann. Theu, Aldus and other Editors give ἄν με. But dn cannot

we ought to read dud, and he has been followedby recent
Editors. Ι think however that the true reading' ιι that of Reiske,
oin με θρᾷν χρεῶνς It happens frequently that* αν has ereptus
instead of ὧν, in similar cases, owing to this construction not having
been understood.
