ys seems to be used lor adv, contrary to its nature. The reading
which 1 have admitted into the textis that· of Duport, ,οι rather
of Scaliger, except that he has το δ’ ἑθελειν. Hermann gives
θέλων γι, το θέλειν ουκ ἔχων α’λιγῦνομαι.

v. 568. 'l'he reading of the editions was ’Άλλονι ὀλεῖ πρόσθεν,
ἅ με διολέσαντ’ εχει. Ροιιοιιί emendationis τρ6σ6’” ope,
which 1 have admitted for two ιιιιιοιιιι it restores the numbers
of the verse, and gives its proper emphasis to tho pronoun, which
sunda ιιι opposition to ἄλλους Hermann thinks differently, and
gives ια ingenio αλλονς dhe? πρόσθ,” ινα με διολέσαντ’ εχει.

v. 571. Που τους Φρύγαι λέγουσιν ῳκίσθαι, adrem] 'l'he
copies have ᾠκῆσθαι. Porsen reads ᾠκίσθαι, and adduces v. 615
and Hec. 2 There seems to be no sufficient reason for Ehnsley’s
proposal‚ τον γῆς.

. v. 572. Oo' μηποτ οὶκιιν ὤφελ’ ο Πριάμου [lapsa] lean-
not help suspecting that the Poet might have given it, ον μήποτ’
ὄφελ’ o Πριάμου φῦναι Πάρις.

v. 573. Μακρᾶνγ’ α’παὶρειι, ω πάτερ, λιπών ἐμὲ] This
line' rs commonly read interrogatively‚ and without'y'. But most
of the MSS have wnpdv‘y’. Elmsley remarks that itis not ι
question.

v. 574. Eos rovedo, ω θύγατερ, σν ””θ nasse σῳ πατρί]
Suebis the reading of all the copies3 but it is palpably corrupt,
and openly offends against the lawe of the metre. Porson‚ in treating
of his canon respecting the fisth foot of the Senarius, marshsls
this amongst the rebellione instantes to be found' ιιι the Tragedians,
and proposes to substitute for ιι the following line, Ω θνὙατερ,
ἥκεις καὶ σύγ etv ταὺτον πατρι, which Gaisford has admitted .
into the text. But the most devoted admirere of our great 'Critic
must allow his alteration to be violent: 1 think it may easily be
demonstrated to be erroneous. Wherever the phrase eis ταὺτὸν
ἥκω occurs, those words will, 1 believe, be found ιο adhere closely
together, and not to alloy the interposition of any others3 see
v. 1354. Ἀλλᾶ μην εις rabodo ἥξει. Hec. 736. Orest. 1274 Electa
787. Secondly, ys„ is an unmeaning expletive Thirdly, the force
of the sentence is impalred by the omission of σῷ. However, the
efforts of his rival Hermann have met with no better success. He
produces Eis-*woodo ημειι σοι, σν '“0' ηκεις σῷ werpe: which
does not sound like a verse of ancient Trogody, ,and will ιιοι’ bear
examination. One thing only seems to be clears the words of
