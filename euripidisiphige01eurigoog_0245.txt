v. 1372. The editions give ‘ivo τε deipara μεμονε laia [δι’
ἑμιίν ονομα ruod] Αὐλίδος σ. ὅ. (except that Brubach and some
following edd. have τᾶς γ). Portus translates it, ubi hustoe (i. e.
tumoe hastulae) monent propter meum amnem Musgrave, ubi naver
bellicae munemne propter meam nomeu But the meaning of μέμονε
is widely different; it is a verb horrowed by the Tragedians from
Homer, where it is frequent, and implies, to be resoloed, deter-
mined, eoger for octium μέμονα seems indeed the singular of the
verb whose plur. and part. μεμάασι and penurie, occur so continu-

speura and ships, either Portus' or Musgrave's interpretation of
that word may be defended. 1 should prefer the latter, on account
of ὅρμοις which follows One thing, 1 hope rs clear3 that 1 have
done right rn exeluding the words δι” endu ονομα, they having
been inserted by some one who thought that Iphigenia was speak-
ing, and believed, as the grammarians told him, that μέμονε was
a tense of μενοι, and implied the detentioo of the armament Even
had it borne that sense, the words added would have been un-
meaning: they should rather have been-«li ἑμῆν ψυχήν. The
pronoun τᾶσδ’ came from the same hand as in v. 1208. Hs
thought that as Ainis occurred twice with eide in the play, it
ought to have the same adjunct whenever it was named. By this
purgatiori of the sentence, the trochaic mette is relieved, much
better than by writing ίᾷα, as is done by Hermann.

circumstance would be enough to raise suspicion respecting a line

The MSS. indeed have Μυκηναῖοι, and most scholars since Canter
and Scaliger read θεροίπναι. but neither of these changes will
make it probabis that the words can belpng to Euripides. The
interpolator thought that πόλιομα Περσέως meant only Myrene,
and that this city therefore should be named by the dying maiden.
But Euripides, here as elsewhere, speaks of Argos and Mycenae
