Auour the concluding scene of this Tragedy, something still
remains to be noticed. Dr Samuel Musgrave in his Exercitationes
irs Euripidem, publ. 1761. lirst pointed out the following passage

of AElian‚ De Animal. vn. 29 ο di Evprrrid ηε ἐν τῇ ’,Ιφνγενεῖᾳ
’ἔλαφον d Ἀχαιῶν χερσὶν ἐνθήσω φίλαις

κθρθνσσαν, ην σφαζθντθς αυχησουσῑ (mv

σφάζειν θνγᾶτερα

Ηε justly inferred that these lines could suit no speaker except
Diana, and thence concluded that they were part of the lost Pro-
logue of the Iphigenia in Aulis, and were addressed hythe goddess
to Agamemnon. Musgrave's opinion was embraced by Markland and
by Boeckh ; they seem to have been reconciled to the improbabilities
of this theory, by its supplying an argument to show that thia
Tragedy, like all the others of Euripides which survive, originally
began with a Prologue. Porson, at the time of writing his Proehctio
in Euripidem in 1792, concurred in this opinion: See Adversaris p. 9.
But in 1802 he had formed a justet judgment3 he then said (Suppl.
’ Proef. Hec. p. xxi), “ Nec quicquam mea refert3 quippe qui per-
suasus sim, totam eam scenam abusque versu 1541 spuriam ease
et a recentiori quodam, nescio quando„ certe post AEliani temporo,
suppositam.” As thia has an obvious reference to AElian'a quotation
from Diana's speech, it follows that Porson must have been con·
vinced that the lost passage formed not the beginning but the
conclusion os the Tragedy, that it was addressed by Diana not
to Agamemnon but to Clytaemnestra, who remained upon the stage,
and that the spurious scene which puts a narrative of the sacrifice
and the miraculous introduction ol' a dcer, Tragicoe furtivo piaculo
cervoe, into the mouth of the Ἄγγελος, had been substituted sor the
conclusion as given by Euripides· Such is also the opinion of
Matthia and Hermann and of other learned men mentioned in
their annotations.

Το point out the faults and enormities which convict the con-
cluding scene (p. 69) of forgery, would be a superfluous task at the

⁸ Ioannot help suspecting that AElian’s memory deceived him in making this
quotation, and that, instead of pilate, the word ot' Euripides was λάθρα.
