word beginning with μν here and in another line of this Tragedy
v. 749. Ἀλλ’ ἦ πέπονθα δεινάς μνηστεύω ‘ydaove-Before
Markland, it was read illoesa with an anapaest for the second foot.
Elmsley (Edind. Rev. Vol. xvrr. p. 499.) proposes dedetis, alleging
the rarity of an elision in words similar to ilina. However, he
himself refers to six other instances in Euripides3 and there ap-
pear to be objections of a different kind opposed to his conjecture:
if a participle were to be used at all, it should, 1 apprehend, be
(iotis, not Baloie: and as the proposed reading makes it necessary
that the stop aster φίλαι v. 68. should be removed, the sentence

would become needlessly embarrassed. Hermann, however, has
embraced Elmsley's conjecture. ' .
v. 68. Ὅτῳ nvom φοροιεν Ἀφροδίτας φίλαι] The common

reading ss ὅτου. Matthiae has adopted Heathh emendation* onon:
1 should consider‘l οπη preferable. But Ι have adopted, as easier
and more probable, ὅτῳ, which has been already proposed by
Boissonade3 I understand the sense to be, To mhomsoeoer lle fond
galee ty* love might carry her.

v. 69. Hl εἵλεθ, οε σφε μήποτ ωφελεν λαβεῖν, Μενέ-

λαον] Every edition has‘ tos γε μήποτ ὤ. λ. except Hermann's
which gives nis δέ. My own emendation ds σφε appears so in-

dubitable, thal am rather surprised rt should have lieen len for
me to introduce it.

v. 70. Helen. 27. ipsa loquitur. λιττῶν <ll βούσταθμ’ Ἰδαῖος
Πάρις Σπάρτην ἀφίκεθ’, οἷς ε’μόν σχήσων λέχος. Elmsley (Mos.
Cril. 11. p. 296) ingeniously conjectures βούσταθμ’ Ἰδαίας χθονὸς,
from this passage of the Iphigenia. Clemens Alexandrinus quotes
the six following lines to Μενέλαον (Paedag. 111. 2.) In v. 71.
he writes κρίνων for κρίνας.

v. 72. ἀνθηρὸς μὲν εἱμάτων στολῇ Χρυσῷ τε λαμπρός]
The manuscripts of Clemens have στολήν, which pleases me better
than στολῇ. Then Ι should prefer χρυσῷ dai, that le* may answer
to μεν in the preceding lines; for I cannot assent to the opinion
of Elmsley who compares this passage with Bacch. 453. Ἀτοῖρ τό
μεν σωμ’ ονκ ἄμορφος εΙ, ilva: where μὲν ἰο emphatic from
having no correspondings δέ.

v. 75. aad ημον λοβῶν Μενέλαον] Haoing strand Menelaus
adrood. There is no need for Markland's correction λαθών. In
Tro. v. 949. Helen herself relates this story.
