In the first place, it is neither possible to join διάπροποι πριίποιι,
nor do Ι believe that the word drrirporror has any existence3 what

follows, ὁδ’ dyadis, is equally corrupt. 'l'he reading 'which l have
given 'is that of Professor Monk‚ who printed this strophe and anti-
strophe in a publication called Cambridge Classical Examinations
in'the year 182⁴lr (Hopfner had proposed διάφοροι for διιίτροποι,
Barnea τρόποι, and Musgrave ‘rd δ’ ὀρθῶς) Hermann edits
διάτροποι δὲ τρόποι· what follows he gives rightly, πδ δ’ ipo—⁴
ὣς ἐσθλδν σαφὲς ciel: claiming it as his own emendation, un-
doubtedly in ignorance that the same had been put forth by Mus-
grave long before him. In Iph. T. 611. there ‘is found a similar
error, ὀρθιίς for ὀρθῶς. Secondly, Ihave corrected παιδονομί-
νων for rarissimarum The following translation gives the sense
„of the passage, Diversa mortalium ingenia, diuersi μονοις sed qaid
· uere domam sit, semper maaifeaum. Quia et educatio earum qui
liberaliter instituantur, magnopere confert ad uirtutem. ln the neat
place, all the critics, from Scaliger downwards, agree in reading
σοφία ip'stead of the dative3 the sense being uerecundia est aa·
piratio. l will candidly avow that I have abstained with some
difficulty from introducing certain conjectures of my own for th'e
reformation of this passage, which I should like to record here:—
Τροφαί θί, al παιδευομένοις Μέγα φέρουσιν eir ἀρετάν· Τό
Ι πε ’γιίρ αἰδεῖσθαι σοφίαν llrivr’ ἐξαλλάσσουσαν ἔχει Χάριν, sirmi
‘yvripp τ’ ἑσορᾷν Τὸ δέον. Future critica may possibly approve
some of the changes at which 1 have hinted. Instead uf δόξαν,
Βοιαει restored δόξα, which both metra and sense demand. 1 have
further corrected ἔνθεν and βιοτᾶς, the latter appearing rather
better than Markland's βιοτᾷ. Ι have already remarked how fond
Euripides is of attaching the genitive βίον to the end of a moral
sentence. What remains of the antistrophe is more difficult to
unravel, on account of the palpable corruption in vv. 490. 491.
from which nobody can extract sense, without some rather auda·
ciuus conjecture The general meaning of the sentence appears
tolerably clesr; the poet designed to place in coutrast the very
different courses in which reputation is to be obtained by the two
sexes ; while the fair farne of women arises from the virtuous direc-
tion of meir domestic affections, (for such is=the sense of sarri
