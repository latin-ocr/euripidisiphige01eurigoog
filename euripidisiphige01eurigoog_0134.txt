namnum m auris. 103

v. 349. The early edd. have διῆξε, which Barnes and others
fancy to be derived from doira. Portus and Markl. restored διῇξει
but the first editor who pointed the sentence properly was L. Dindori'.

v. 351. οἱ ‹l' εὐδαίμονες Ἐν πᾶσι κλεινοί καί περίβλεπτοι
βροτοῖς] Ι will not dispute that Euripides might have written
βροτοῖς, but 1 must think it far rnore likely that he gave what I

’ have printed in the margin, βροτῶν, and that this was afterwards
altered into the dative by a transcribet on account of ἐν πᾶσι.
I need not observa that οῖ εὐδαίμονες βροτῶν corresponds with

the Tragic style of speaking, and' rs supported by another passage
of this drama, v. 515. where the sentiment expressed' rs almost

identical with the present, θεοι d οι κρείσσους οι τ ὀλβοφόροι
Τοῖς ουκ εὐδαίμοσι θνητῶν.

ν 353. One Paris MS. has προίσσοτε, the other πράσσεται,
with e written over it as a various lection. In v. 359. these MSS.
give στεφανουσθαι. ,

, v. 356 Αρτέμιδι προτελίζουσι την νεανι do] Compare v. 627.
l'lpore'hetad ἤδη ward dr ’ἔσφαξας θεᾷς This custom is explained
by the Grammarians, Hesychius v προτέλεια, Photius, Harpo-
oration, and others, but particularly by Pollux 111. 38. ἡδί πρὸ
*γιίμων θυσία Προτὲλεια-προτελεῖσθαι le* ἐλέγοντο ου μόνον
αι νυμφαι, α’λλυί καί οἱ ννμφίοι. καί τέλος o ’γάμος ἐκαλεῖτο,
καί τελεῖοι oi ‘yc'youryco‘rea hd τοῦτο καί Ἥρα τελεία, η
{ayla ταιίτῃ μίρ ἐν τοῖς προτελείοις τρουτὲλουν ‘sols κόρας,
καί Apre'utdl‚ καί Μοίραις. where one MS. of Pollux instead

οἲ προτελεισθαι has τροτελίζεσθαι, and instead of προντέλουν
, others have τρουτέλιζον. Hence the use of the word' tn this
line rs sufficiently sanctioned.

v. 357. τίς νιν ἄξεταί ποτε;] “Cum aycodou acorem
ducere significat, είς δόμους, vel aliquid ejusmodi plerumque ad-
dunt Tragici.'' Elmsley on Heracl. 808. He observes however
thatin this verse of the Iphigenia, the verb, used simply, implies
to marry.

v. 358. Ἀλλ’ εἷα, τοίπί τοισίδ’ ἐξάρχου κανᾶ] Aldus
has ταπι τοῖσιδ’, but σοῖσι d crept into subsequent editions,
until it was corrected by Cantor Compare v. 1349. ΚανοῖιλΗ εναρ-
χέσθω τις

v. 859. Στεφαυουσθο κρᾶτα] There ις no necessity for Mark-
land's correction στεφανοῦ τε κρᾶτα. Matthiae observes* ⁶-Aga
