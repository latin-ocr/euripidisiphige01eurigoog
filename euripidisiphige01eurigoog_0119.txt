88 Νινιιιι ou ιιιιι >

v. 169. Markland conj. ἠϊθέων. Βαι ἡμιθέων is the reading
of all the copies, and' rs defended by Homer Il. Μ. 28. ημιθέιον
‘ye'voc ανδρῶν, from which passage Euripides seems to have taken
this word. oda for ὦς is the correction of Scaliger.

ι.170. ἐλάταις χιλιόναυσιν] So' ιιι υ. 276, νεῶν Χιλιιυν
ἅρχων, is applied to Agamemnon. ln Orest. 316. Menelaus' ιι ac·
costed‚ Ω χιλιόναυν στράτου ὁρμήσαι Εις ’γᾶν Ἀσίαν Χαῖρ.

The Tragedians, and after them Virgil and other Latin Poets,
fix the number of ships' m the Trojan expedition at 1000. People
who are exact remark the number in Homer's catalogue ιο be

1¹83: 172, Edd. e've'rrovo’. This as wellas the following verse

is in my arrangement Glyconeue ΡοὶμιοΙιοοιαιὶιιιιοι a species of
metra frequently occurring in this Tragedy.

v. 175. αἰι Εὑριότα δονακοτρόφου] There rs a similar
epithet of the Eurotas ιιι lph. Τ. 100. τόν ευυδρου ιιαι δονακο-
χλόαν λιπόντες Εὐρωταν.

v. 179. Ἥρᾳ Παλλαδι τ εριν ἔριν Μορφᾶι α Κυπρις

εσχεν] Ροιιοιι herc notes,‘ ‘Melius forsan legeretur εριν ἔκρινε
μορφᾶς, αν Κόπριι” εσχον.” This was a juvenile correction of
the great Critic; and although made for metrical reasons, it would
in fact injure the metre: Νιρέα ιιι the Antistr. v. 201. is a dissyl-
lable. ιρις is repeated ιιι a similar manner in v. 505 of this play,
and εριν in Helen. 256. The measure is a Glyconean followed

by a Pherecratean3 than which there rs no mode of terminating
a Strophe more οοιιιιιιοιι οι more harmonious.

v. 182 ὀρομένα is a correction of Canter for the common .
reading όριυμὲυαυ.

v. 181. νεοθαλεῖ Doric for υεοθηλει. See Hom. 11AE ..347
Τοῖσι δ υπο χθιδυι δῖα φύει νεοθηλέα ποιηυ The Scholiast
explains the epithet by νειυστι θαλλουσαυ.

ν. 187. ιιιιιιυν τ όχλου ιδὲσθαι] The old editions have
ἵππιον όχλου τ ἰδέσθαι. but most of the MSS. omit τ. It

seems therefore that Aldus supplied the conjunction, but put it
in the wrong place. The correction is Heath's.

v. 190. Toto Σαλαμῖνος στέφανον Ald. This arose from the
reading of some MSS. Σαλαμινίοις. The edition of Brubach' gives
a better reading, τῆς, which ought to have been τᾶιτ but 1 trust

that my own restoration τόν Σ. σ. is more probable. I must
