different from one another. Aa all the other commentatam are silent,

women of the Chorus assist her in preparing for the altar. Bro-
daeus and Markland notice the absence of any expression of com·
passion from the Chorus, and think that two iambic lines, after this
speech and before the song, may have been lost. Such a custom
however is by no means so general aa to cause surprise at its
omission; and it is more probable that the Poet did not choose hy

appear, independently of the name ο1 this great critic? iphigenia

to the altar was sudden, and without the least preparatiou; and aa
Lucretius well observes in commenting upon her case, natandi tarn·
