should heve patiently endured the expression νυμφίοισι παρθένοις,
ss it is quite certain thsttbe Poet could not have used that term
to express uirginibus nubentibus. The fuet ia, that it was borrowed
(ugrecably to the practice of this lorger of verses) from v. 642.
There, however, νυμφίοις properly expresses sponso et ιροαιιτ.
Hermann has a notion of reading νυμφίοισι παρθένιον, ιιιιᾰ ex·
pluining it nuptiis uirginum. But neither would this be Euripi-
dean. If any such sentence had been required, the verb in the pre·
ceding line ought ιο have been εὐτρέπιζε, σοι tole aliquid,.rother
than πρᾶσσε. As soon as this verse is cut ont, the mind und
spirit of the queen are perfectly expressed, Go you, und attend ιο
matters obruad, subde 1 purete ιίιε domestic dulice of ο suffe.

v. 650. 'rhe translations of this plny continue to render μάτην
- ᾖξ’, frustra vens ; although Barnes declared, nearlye century and
a half ago, thet ᾖξε was the aorist from α’ίσσιυ, conor, aggredior.
Alter v. 654, Ihave expunged three more lines, for doing ulrich 1
think the lovers of Euripides will feel obliged ιο me. Although the
editors are generally silent respecting them, yet I apprehend that
hardly any render of the Tragedy can have failed to be offendetl
ιιι their intrusion. Not to dwell upon their being both ilat and
. useless, it seems improbable that Agamemnon should introduce
such matters, ιιι the moment when his mind was occupied with
his own misourriage, and the unmanageable temper of his wife.
Hermann hus taken ih hund the second of these lines, and corrected
it thus, Td τῆς θεοῦ μὲν φίλου, ἐμοί d' οὑκ εὐτυχές. But this
leaves an expression which seems very bad Greek, sd τῆς θεοῦ
φίλον, the pleosure of sse goddess. ἑξιστορῆσιυυ elus is translated
deprecaturus eo; but it would be interrogaturos ibo. 1 do not re·
member to heve met with thot future in any other place.

v. 654. Χρὴ δ’ ἐν δόμοισιν ἄνδρα τᾶν σοφιίν τρέφειν
Γυναῖκα χρηστήν κὰγαθνίυ, ἢ μή τρέφειν] Hermsrm pro-
nounces this remark tu be absurd3 but thinks tlrut all would be
right, if it were written in sn inverted order, ἢ μή τρέφειν
γυναῖκα, ἢ χρηστὴν ιιοὶγαθιίν τρέφειν. This strictme contsins
more subtlety than truth3 it comes to the sume thing in effect,
whicheverof the two conditione has the precedence. Neither is
there any occasion for his alteration, ἢ μή γαμεῖν, since the same
thing is implied by ἢμῆ τρέφειν γυναῖκα.
