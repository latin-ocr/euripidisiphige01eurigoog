the other two lines cited, Hermann admits that eis οἴκους, ἐν οἴκοις,
ἐξ οἴκων and the like are legitimate, because a person who enters a

house, or is in a house, or leaves a'house, may be said to enter, to
reside in, or to leave tlte apartments of that house. But not so those
who stand in front of the building ; they stand before tlte whole
tonse. Therefore πρόσθεν or πάροιθεν οἴκων is to be condemned.

But even this distinction, however fine, will not prove sufficient:
for there are many places in which occur the expressions s'y‘ytidsv
οἴκων, τηλόθεν οἴκων, στείχειν πρός circus, ἀπ’ οἴκων. It will
therefore be necessary either to alter those passages, or to invent
a new line of discrimination, which may admit such forms, but
exclude πάροιθεν οἴκων. Having entered my protest against such
super-astute distinctions, l must observe that if any valid objection
could bc established against πάροιθεν οἴκων, it would surely bc
a safer mode of emendation to substitute ciaon, which suits tha
verse quite as well, than to introduce into the text, as Hermann
has done, τῆσδε, τῶν πάροιθεν οἴκων, hujus, ec priore dossas
mode of speech which, to say the least, is awkward as well as un-

, necessary.

v. 764. Ἦ μόνω παρόντε θῆτα ταῖσδ’ ἐφέστατον πόλαιις]
This line is printed by Aldus with several corruptions, ἦ μόνῳ
πάροιθεν θῆτα παῖδ’ (the last word 1 have omitted to mention at
the bottom of the text). In the later editions the other faults have
been set right on the authority of the MSS. and πάροιθε hasbeen
substituted, metri gratio. But that word is at any rate super.
fluous, aud the fact of its being written with the final v tenda to
prove thatit was taken from the verse two lines above. Dobree
observes (Adsere. ii. p. 84) “ παρόντε legendum, et nescio an sic
Porsonus. In πάροιθε, quod ex 860 (762) fluxit, acquiescit Ehns-
leius ad Heracl. 583.” From Hermann's note I learn that παρόντε
has ¹also been proposed by Bothe, and by Lenting. Το which of
the four critica priority belongs, Ι am not avare ; but it is pro·
bable that the same emendation has occurred to above a hundred
other scholars3 I am sure that it did so to myself long ago3 andl
think that there are few restorations in the text of this Tragedy
more clear and certain. Hermann does not say what fault he
basto find with it, but substitutes an emendation of his own,
ἦμόνιν ’γάρ cide όῆτα ταῖσδ’ ἐφέστατον willam

v. 765. Ὡς μόνοιν λόγοις ἄν· ’ἔξω δ’ ἐλθὲ βασιλείων δόμων]
μόνοιν is Markland's emendation for μόνοις. As the inquiry refers
