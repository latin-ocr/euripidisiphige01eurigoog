IPHIGENIA IN AULIS. Ἴ 125

Euripides have been so roughly handled by copiers or correctore,
who altered them to suit their·own actions of the meaning and
syntax of the verse, that it is *impossible to recover them with
certainty. I have suggested in the margin such a line aa 1 think
might have been found in the ancient copies: but 1 desire that it
nray not be considered as an emendation, to be introduced (as those
of Porson and Hermann have been) into the text of the Poet. 1
make no pretence of having correcmd the corrupt reading. The
verse which Ι propound claime nothing more than this: lt gives
the sense of the passage, without. offending against correct metre
or diction, and without any violation of the practice¹ of our Poet
l shall merely add that the words σιΙ σῷ arnapi, which composa
the two last feet, occupy a similar placem Hipp116a.

v 575. Elei* ην καλον ε’μοΙ ool τ, ἄγειν ξύμπλουν ἑμέ.]
instead of the common reading καλον μοι Ι have written καλον
ε’μοΙ, which rs indispensably required on account of σοΙπ with
which it is coupled, as in v. 1340. Μέν, ὠς ἑμοΙ πε σοΙ πε
’ καλλιον ‘r'o'rla The verse in Hermann's text is, Em, ην καλον
μοι σοΙ ‘y ιἸγειν σιΙμπλονν ε’μεΙτ which Ι am afraid that l do
not perfectly comprehend.

v. 576. ''Er'' εστι καΙ σοι πλονς,” ι’να μνήσει πατρός] This
is a felicitous emendation by Porson (Sappl. Proef. Heo. p. 87.)
for the common reading ΑΙπειςΙ τις καΙ ool—He compares Med.
367. ΙἘτ εΙσ α’γῶνες τοῖς νεωστὶ ννμφΙοις. Hermann gives
Ἀλλ’Ι εστι rol σοΙ πλονς, which would be eligible, were not the
correction of Porson much nearer to the letters found ιιι the old
copies, and therefore more likely to be me genuine reading.

v. 577· ΞιΙν μητρι ΙἸπλεν’σασ, ημόνη πορεύσομαι 3] Elmsley
wishes to put a note of' interrogation aster πλεῦσασς for which
l see no reason: πλεύσασα significa leaving ser soil. .

v. 579. ΙἨπονΙ μ ἐς ἄλλα ὄμματ’ οΙιιΙζεις, aavep3] ἄλλα
δώματα, ιἸλλοι donor, and the like, are terma frequently used' ιιι
expressing the alter'ed condition of a bride. Thus ιιι v. 598.
οταν αλλοις δόμοιο Παῖδας παραδιδῷ πολλα μοχθήσας πατέρ.
Instead of ἦπου most MSS. have ον που, and this rs embraced by
Hermann3 but that learned editor states a reason why he had better
have chosen the other:“ ἦπου est expectaveris affirmationem,'' ον πον
metuentis? It may be observed that though Iphigenia, from feel·
inge of virgin modesty, would not mention the word marriage,
she was not quite ignorant of the cause for which her mother had
