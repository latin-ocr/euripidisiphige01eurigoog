present day. Much os the narrative is a lamentable plagiarium from
the account given byralthybius in the Hecuba ol* the sacrifice of
Polyxena So servile is the imitation, and so inconceivable the
want of judgmeut displayed by this writer, that he makes Achilles,
whose generosity had just excited admiration, officiare as a party in
the sacrifice, and deliver an address to the goddess by whom it was
exacted, (See v. 87) this being done in imitation os his son, N eopto·
lemus, in the Hecuba. In the dying speech of th'e maiden, the
copyist only alters enough'ol' his model to make it his own3 as v. 28.

respecting Titus Andronicus, falsely attributed to Shakespear: “l
know not that this piece stands in need of much emendation;
though it might be treated as condemned criminals are in some
countries,-any experiments might be justifiably made on it”

Hermann thinks that the compilet possessed a copy of the
Tragedy from which the last leaf had been accidentally lost, or
which had been left unfinished by the haste or carelessness of the
scribe ; and that he accordingly determined to supply the deficiency.
1 rather apprehend that he found the piede perfect, but wishing
it to conclude with a narrative, and esteeming his own powers of
composition as at least equal to those of Euripides, he substituted
his production, and destroyed that of the Poet, aster having stolen
from it what suited his purpose. I am led to believe this to
have been the fact from the first words,

ai Τυνδαρεία παῖ Κλυταιμνήστρα-
