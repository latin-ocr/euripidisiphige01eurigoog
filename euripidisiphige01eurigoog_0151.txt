been informedof the parentage of Achilles, though she did :not
yet know the particulars of his ancestry. ln all the editions, four
verses follow, the last of which Porson condemns as spurious
Miro. crit. p. 223. Matthiae justly denouncea them all four, as the
production of a clumsy interpolator. ln my edition, they. will be
found printedin small characters under the ¹text of the Tragedian.
The following are Matthiae's observatione upon them, ·“ In his
versibus plura sunt, quae offendant ‘Primum κάθησο verum esse
non potest, quum jam de curru descenderint, et mox Iphigenia
dicatur πλησίον σταθεῖσα. Markl. conj. καθίστα, quod probat
Musgr. Sed tota sententia languet, sive κάθησο sive καθίστα
lagas3 cur enim Iphigeniam juxta se adstare jubeat, squae ‹vix ab
ea abscesserat? Reliqua non minus mira sunt. Quam impeditus
,est hic verborum ordo: Τέκνον Ἰφνγένεια, δεῦρο πρὸς μητέρα,
καθίστα ἑξῆς ποδός μον (sic constructionem ordinat Markl.)-·
Tum quis unquam dixit μακάριόν τινα daddvor? Tota vero sen-

confess that the faults here pointed out by Matthiae, joined

with several others which he omits, appear to me to he such ' ¹

strong indicatione of forgery, as· to make it almost incredible

⁸ that any body versed in the language of Tragcdy‚ can imagine

them to be genuine. The case however is very different. ¹Pro-
fessor Hermann pronounces these verses to be our Poet's, and to
require nothing but emendation. Accordingly he changes κᾶθησο
into καθεῖσα, de' με into ε’μὲ, and determines that τέκνον is an
accusative, and that it implica the infant child Orestes The reader
will exercise his own judgment on this question.

v. 543. The forger, whoever he was, not content with inserting
‘in this scene so much of his own manufacture, has altered the order
of the genuine verses'of the Tragedian, in such a manner as to
occasion additional perplexity. The whole, however, has been de-
tected with his characteristic acuteness by Professor Porson. The
two lines in which Clytaemnestra accosts her husband on his first
appearance were made by the Interpolator to follow ¹those of
Iphigenia ; this being done in order to introduce three more
precious lines of his own3 they are,
