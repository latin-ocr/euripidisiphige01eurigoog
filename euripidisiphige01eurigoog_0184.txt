ΙΡοιιοῐι also ventured on two juvenile emendations of this verse,
which his maturer judgment would have been sure to repudiate.

serves to explain that before us, but which Markland (Suppl. 1035)
used as the foundation of a very unhappy attempt at alteration:

harrassed and made clear a passage which has hitherto been very
perplexed‚ and has given rise to various interpretatione. The first
cause of misunderstanding seems to have been that in every edition
