ν. 699. The editions give the next three lines as'follows‚
· τίς ἀρα μ’ εὖπλοκάμους κόμας
ἔρυμα δακρυόεντ’ ἀκούσας
πατρίδος οὐλομένας ἀπολωτιεῖ.
It would be tedious to narrate all the conjectures to which this

passage has given rise. But in the second line, which is palpably
corrupt, some copies have δακρυόενπ’ ἀνύσας, and two Paris MSS.
have distinctly δακρυόεν πάννσαςτ there cen therefore be little or
no doubt that this is the reading to be adopted: but then we en·
countcr great difficulty in explaining ἔρυμα. Ι have in a preceding
verse, 678, declared my opinion that the word has no business in
this line. Aa soon as it is taken out, the sentence will be un-
ravelled. Hermann's substitution of ῥῦμα, tractus, does not remove,

but merely changes the difficulty. δακρυόεν seems to be used ad-'
verbially, inter lacrymas, asin Hom. ΙΙ. Ζ. 484. δακρυόεν ’γελό-
σασα. The expression ἀπολωτιεῖ may be compared with the Sup-
plices of our Poet‚ 491. κάπολωτίζει νέους. Instead of ον’λομένας,
which is the Homeris form, 1 have written ὀλομένας, and Ι think
that the seme should be done in Iph. T. 1108. ndpywv οὐλομένων
Matthiae and Hermann adopt ἀλλυμένας from Erfurdt

ν. 695. Διά σέ, τάν κόκνου δολιχαύχενος έκεγονονς] All the
editions and MSS. have γόνον, but 1 do' not recollect any place
in which ιγόνος is used for a daughter, except Orest. 1036, where
Electra says, Σό νυν μ’, ἀδελφέ, μή τις Ἀργείων κπάυῃ,
Ὕβρισμα θέμενος τόν Ἀγαμέμνονος ’γόνοντ and there the Scho·
liast has preserved a various lection, δόμου, which Porson and other
’ editors have neglected to mention. Nor indeed would ’γόνου suit
the metre in‘ our verse: 1 have therefore written έκὙονον. Theline
is asynartete, consisting of a Trochaic dipodia and three dactyls. Ι
have placed a note of interrogation after this line, though perhaps
it might with 1more propriety be reserved for the end of the Epode:
but the sentence runs into so many different topics, that before
we have reached the end, its interrogative character is apt to be

forgotten. It is commonly written διά σε.

y .ν. 696. Aldus, and other old Editors have,

ei ,δὴ φάτις ἔτυμος, ,
αἶς έτυχε Λήδ όρνιὸ ἱπταμένῳ,
Διός ὅτ’ ἀλλόχθη, δέμας,
εἴτ’ έν δέλτοις Πιερίσι, κ. π. λ.
