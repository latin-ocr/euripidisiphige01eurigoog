¹ v. 1252. lt continued to be published ἐμὲ δὲ τί χρὴ θρᾷν
τότε; in opposition to the metre, and without the notiee of any
editor, till Dr Gaisford restored the verse by transposing·)(pri ri.

v1125s. uls τοῦθ οὕνεκ’ οὗ σφαγήσεται] Elmsley on Med.
⁵96. (Ὼτ οὐ κρινοῦμαι τῶνδέ σοι τοὶ πλείονα) “als sortiter
affirmantis eat, ut ἰ’σθι ais.'' He cites many examples from the
Tragedies of this usage of uis with the future, and the present
line among the rest; bathis proposed alteration of τοῦθ’ to τῆσθ,
is unnecessary. Matthia properly explains τοῦθ’ by τοῦ fai αὐτῆς
ἀντέχεσθαι. Hecuba's declaration on a similar occasion is con·
veyed in similar language,' Hec. 400. Ὠς τῆσδ’ ἑκοῦσα raedis
ori μεθήσομαι. Brodaeus rendere τοῦθ οὕνεκ’, quod'altinel ad froci

These words used to be written interrogatively3 an error remarked
by Heath. Some MSS. have ἕνεκ’.

ν. 1254. The common reading is Ἀλλοὶ priv εἱς τοῦτό ’γ’ ἥξει,

⁴ which Barnes explains by supposing Achilles at this moment either

to lay his hand on his sword, orto point to his faithful soldiers,
who were prepared to fight in defence of the maiden. Several
commentatore have adopted this action, and Brumoy renders it,·
Volci qui rue repoudra uella.. Hermann explains the words differ-¹
endy, Atqui, eo irraletur, ut ea amplexu tuo eam caueatur abstrahere.
Such a remark appears so utterly useless aster what he had already
said, that l have adopted eis ταῦτδν ἥξει, u mill come to therama
thing. Musgrave, followedby Matthia, proposed ταύτό γ’. of
the phrase eie ταὺτθν ἥκω, Ι have spoken in my note on v. 574.
l cannot see the absurdity which Hermann discovers in this reading.
Though Achilles had in reply to the mother’s inquiry, ruhat she
should be doing, told her-to cliug to her daughter, it is natural that
he should now add that this would still leave her in the same
danger, and that her preservation must be affected by those other
means to which he had alluded5 Perhaps ἥξεις may be preferable.

The speech of Iphigenia, in all editions except this, begins with
μῆτερ, εἰσακούσατε Τῶν ε’μῶν λόγων. l do not object to
εἰσακούσατε after μῆτερ on mere grammatical grounds ; for if the'
address had been intended for several persons, the plural might
be used; see v. 359. But all the early part of the speech is ad-
dressed ιο her mother exclusively: 1 have therefore given elao-
xovore'ov. Elmsley on Heracl. 535. says “Cum hac Macaria oratione
comparanda Polyxenae oratio in Hoc. 342. Iphigenia in lph. A.2
