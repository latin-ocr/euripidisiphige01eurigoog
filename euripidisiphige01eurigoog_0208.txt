the word would be not κάθημαι but καθεδοῦμαι. Upon this point

the learned reader must exercise his own judgment.

υ.1073. Ἀπώλεσέν σ’, d τέκνον, ὁ <partious πατὴρ]
Commonly ὁ φυτεύσας πατήρ. I agree with Elmsley in read·
ing φιτύσας, as giving somewhat smoother numbers. Hermann
prefers the other, making νον d φυ the fourth foot It is of some
consequence to observe that d φιτύσας πατὴρ is a frequent
termination of senarians3 and it generally happens that the old
copies have altered that participle to φυτεύσας, the more common
word, in open violation of the metre. See the note of Monk on
Alcest. 305. The numbers of this verse are certainly not the
most harmonious, and l might perhaps suggest a little improve-
ment, by reading d τέκνον, ἀπώλεσέν σ’ ὁ φ. π. or dnoiheoe'v

used a more lax versification than in his earlier compositione.

The lines of Clytaemnestra's speech, which ensue, have caused
great embarrassment to the Editors, between no two of whom
does there appear to be any coincidence of opinion respecting
them. I do not deny the difficulty, or presume to suppose that
my edition will have removed all doubts respecting the readings
and interpretation; but 1 apprehend that I shall have greatly di-
minished them, ifI can establish that the line which follows v.

weak invention of the interpolator. Itis translated Tale premium

nor, if they could, would it suit the speaker's argument. 1 appre-

such a reward as slis for my oure ‹y'lm's doura But though that
would be an intelligible remark, yet the Greek words will not

convey socha meaning. Matthiae suggests that a line has been ’

lost, in which was found the word α’φὶξῃ referring to wpds ‘rods
δόμους. n. nudos joas tm nne with what follows, ..μσς
’ἕπει (for ἐπεὶ) advenies. Hermann prints πρὸ σοῦ δόμοις, talem

prehend. But the productioris of this interpolator seem to defy
, the efforts of criticism to convert them into sense: he rarely
takes the trouble of looking for words to constitute his verses
further than the page before his eyes, and this line is made up
of words which he saw in v. 1065-1069. This intruder being
