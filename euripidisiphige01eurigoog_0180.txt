IPHIGENIA IN AULIS. 149

688. οὑ βαλαίν οιίι-ιοςΙ doec.

The common reading is οὑκ ἐπαιδεσθήσομαί γε. The present

is the first edition (as far as I know) which has admitted Markland's
emendation ε’παιδεσθήσομαι’ γαί, though rt seems to be confirmed

bya similar passage in ν. 1281, Ἑμποδαίν ’γενήσομαι 'yso θνητδι
ουσα πη θεαῖς Ι cannot recognise the validity of the objection
stated by Hann'ann to this reading, that had e’yoi been written in
this place, it would not be found ιιι the next line, τί ’γιίρ e’yd

σὸμεσθα, citing in its defence Herc. F 858 Ἥλιον μαρτυρό-
μεσθα iptio* α δρᾷν ον Βούλομαι. The reader of the Tragedians

requires not to be told how incessantly the plural number rs applied
to the speaker, and how quick the transitionis from singular to
plural. But the verse cited from the Hercules Furens contains rather
an extreme case of this enallage, and is therefore not to be made
the example on which an emendation may be grounded. 'l'he

Paris MSS. have os written over ‘ye‘ye‘rrhi hy some one who

stop at the end of this line. The words ιιιίτηυ μὲν, ἀλλ’ ὅμως may,
