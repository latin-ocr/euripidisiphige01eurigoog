buthe erroneously gives τοῖς μεν λαίφεσι.

v. 1216. This line stands' ιιι all the copies ἦ πολύμοχθον
ἁμερίων. Τλε measure of the preceding lines being anapaestic,
Markland suggested the insertion of τῶν before ἁμερίων. Ι huet
that my introduction of πᾶν has better consulted the sense. This
verse used ιο have ι note of interr. which Heath properly rejected.

v. 1217. In this and the next hnc the imperfect sense and the
unintelligible metre shews that something hes been lost. The old
reading was χρεῶνδέ eve Adon-orum α’νθρασιν ανενρεῖν, affirm-
atively. Barnes gives δι” τι, with this translation, quorsum igitur
opus est hominibus accersere malam sortem? 1 do not comprehend
Musgrave's version, jutum ιιενο aliquid hominibus difficile toleratu?
Hermann writes vd χρεών. My own suggestion of ι probabis mode
of supplying this sentence is given in the margin. lt may occur
to some critice, thet we should have adhered closer to the writing
of the copies by the insertion pf one more letter, mide εχριῶν σ
err Δῦσποτμον ἀνδράσι vectos decepere, (ioi,' ιω ,) Μεγαλο πάθεα,
&c so ιλιι σε might refer to Helen, the mention of whom' mnne-
diately follows. 1 admit that this would account forali the letters
in dd τι, and, what is more, would elevate the spirit of the passage.
But 1 am not satisfied ιλιι ini, ioi could properly he thus inter-

posed in the middle of a sentence ; and 1 think that a transition
from the anapaestic metm, which has prevailed for many lines, to
the trochaic, was not likely to have taken place, except aster a

sufficient pause. ,
vv. 1219—21. ln all editions these lines are given ιο the Chorus.

Blomfield properly notioed that they belong to Iphigenia's song:
and thus they are printed by Hermann. τοῖς used to be prefixed

to Δαναΐδαις, in order to make the verse a Senarian; one Paris
MS. omits it, another hee it inserted by a different hand.

v. 1225. Τόν τε τῆς θεᾶς nardo, τεκνον, ᾧ σι) devp'
ἐλήλυθας] In the Aldine and other old Edd. the verse stands, τόν
τε τῆς θεοῖς araim τέκνον ιγ, ῳ φθενρ ἐλήλυθας. The per-
son who thus altered' rt, seems not to λινε been aware that θεᾶς was
used asemonosyllable and about the trocharc caesura he knewnothrng
Heath restored the mette by writing nardu,' τεκνον, ιο ’γε ιλέ.
