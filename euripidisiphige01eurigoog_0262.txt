If this opinion of the fate experienced by the concluding scene
of the Iphigenia in Aulis be correct, I think it may be added that
few literary losaes are less to be regretted. For although the
introduction of a Divinity at the eud of his plays was a frequent
practice with our author, and although he might in this case
wish to reconcile the fable with that of his Iphigenia in Tauris,
yet such a conclusion must have inevitably weakened those feelings
of pity and admiration which he had already so powerfully excited.
The Tragedy‚ as we now have it, stands in need of no addition
whatever ; its whole oecouomy maintains a sufficient conformity with
the rules of Aristotle, as well as with themora liberal requisites
of modern criticism, and presents to the reader one of the most
engugiug and beautiful specimens which have been preserved of
the Attic Theatre.
