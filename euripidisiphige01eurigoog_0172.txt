murenulam sune. 141

‘ri φεύγεις tabe spoken hd μέσον. Βαι this appears to be one
of the cases in which ys may properly be joined with an impera·
tive, as it preserves its due force; at least' yolo your baad ινιίΙι ntiae.¹

v. 735 αἰδοίμεθ’* αν Ἀ’γαμέμνον, ei ψαύοιμεν ων μή μοι
θέμις] The reading of the editions before Markland's rs, αἰδούμεθ’
dv,a asolecism. He restored the optative from MSS. Then,

four MSS. have si ψαύοιμεν αν, whence Matthiae has printed ι ,

ψανοιμ dv, but seems in his note to repent of having eodone.

v. 739. ssoiouc ’γάμους φύει ἁφασὶαμ” εχει, γύναι] The
common reading rs, 'dtpnod't Barnea altered rt to φής; observing,
miror autera ιιανίιιὶ id( (εφησθ) priua displiceatne. Barnes' qualifi-
cations as a critic were so poor that better scholars seem disposed
ιο reject all that comes from him, even where he rs unquestionably
right. Thus Markland and Musgrave prefer ποῖον ’γάμον inland 3
an emendation every way worse th'an his ; and Hermann devises a
new one, omitting the verb altogether, substituting for it ὠς,
aud thereby destroying the spirit of the speech.

v. 740. παρανόουσα, delirium, out (ff your sensas. H. Stephens,
in Thes. understands the word in this line to mean only perperam
intelligens,⁸ and Markland, rather than suffer the young Prince to
make so ungallant a speech to the Queen, proposes to alter the word,
and read πορινοοῖισα. Ι fear however that we must tolerate the
word of the text in its proper signification. The only way in which
’ Achilles could account for this extraordinary address was, that the
speaker was beside herself.

v. 742. μεμνημένοις Ald. MSS. This continued in the editions
for some ·time; certainly as late as Canter. μεμνημένους was first
introduced into the Commelin edition. (So at least Hermann seyr,
for I have not the copy by me). Ι presume therefore· that it was
a correction by AEmilius Portus. At all events it hasbeen preferred
to thedative by most of the later editors. It appears to me that
either reading is justifiable3 1 have therefore preferred that which
has all ancient authority in its favour.
¹ v. 746. θαύμαζ’, ἐμοὶ ’γοῖρ θαύματ’ dari ‘rai παρὰ σοῦ]
This is one of the lines of the Tragedians which have a tribrach
for the fifth foot, aud are therefore noted as deficient 1n harmony,
by Hermann, Praef. ad Hec. .p xxxvrn. For thre reason I conclude
it was that Dobree corrected τα παρὰ σου into walard σου. Βαι
rba metanoea of thereme formation of the Trimeter are too numerous
