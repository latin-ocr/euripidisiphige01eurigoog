All the editions had κάμός τ’, until Matthiae properly printed
adada 7⁹: the meaning is, aye, aad mine too, aad lter's.

v. 1034. There is an extraordinary variation in the first
words of this line: Aldus has τίν’ ἡδίκησαι; some MSS. πίμ’
ἡδίκησε; others τίν’ εἰμ’ η’δίκησε; (which means τίν’ ον τί μ’)
Ι have followed Matthiae in printing πί δ’ ἡδίκησαι; as being
nearest to the Aldine ,· though it might have been τίς σ’ ἠδίκησα
or πί σ’ aldirnam ο1 τίν’ ἡδίκησα; which last is adopted by
Hermann, who removes these two lines, placing them after v. 1031.
Ι ι1ο not think his reasons for the transposition satisfactory.

v. 1035. Ὀ νοῦς ὅδ’ αύτός νοῦν ἔχων ού τυγχάνει]
Porson quotes Cic. Att. Vll. 3. Causam νοίονι illa cuasa nonhabet:
cetera'a rebus abundat. Erasmus translates this line, aerum ¹astus

Izic astu uacat, Atque ista calliditas paffeato incallida est.

v. 1037. The editions till very lately had l'ldv‘r' olda, καί
μπε’πυσμ’,όί σύ ’γε μέλλεις με δρᾷν· MSS. πέπεισμ’. Elmsley
was the first who corrected it to πεπύσμεθ’ d σύ μ. μ. δ. The ‘
source of the corruption is evident,· πέπυσμαι having been writ-
ten for πεπύσμεθ’ on account of οἶδα, the αι was supposed to
be cut off, and then ’γε was, as usual, summoned to fill up the
metre. Elmsley observes„ “A similar change of numbers occurs
Immediately afterwards ν. 1041, Ἄκουε δή νυν· οίνακαλύψω
’γάρ λόγους, Κούκὲτι παρῳδοῖς χρησόμεσθ’ αίνίγμασιν. So
also v. 436, Λοίθοιμι τοῦτ’ ἂν, ἀλλ’ ἐκεῖν’ ού λη’σομεν
(ού λη’σομαι Abdus). v. 563, Ἀσύνετα νῦν ἐροῦμεν, εί σέ ιγ’
εὐφρανῶ. v. 830, Καί τοῖς Ἀτρείδαις, ἢν μὲν ηἐγιὸνπαι καλῶς, ·
Πεισόμεθ, ὅταν δέ μή καλῶς, ού πείσομαι (πεισόμεθα. Ald.).”

v. 1039. μδ κάμνῃς λέγων continued, like the reading men.
tioned in the last note, to occupy every edition, at least as late
as Matthiae's, though it is as much opposed to syntax as that is
to prosody. The Greeks said uri κάμνε and μη κόμης, but not
μη κόμνης. 11 was corrected by Porson on Hec. 1166.

v. 1040. 1. Ἰδού, σιωπῶ· τό γὰρ ἁναίσχυνπόν με δεῖ,
Ψευδῆ λεήονπα, προσλαβεῖν τῇ ξυμφορᾷ] Thus were these
two lines given in all the editions without scrane, till Elmsley (Q. R.
’ viii. p. 230.) pronounced that we ought to read interrogatively
