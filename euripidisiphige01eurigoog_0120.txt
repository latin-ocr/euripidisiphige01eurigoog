· w.192. Markland is right in observing that ἡδομένους is ap-
plied both to Πρωτεσίλαον and Παλαμήδεα, which are divided
by the ligure called σχῆμα Ἀλκμανικόν. He cites Lesbonax
περὶ Σχημᾶτων p. ¹79· Ἀλκμανικόν· ris, τδ, Πλάτων irnperio
θησαν καὶ Ἀριστοτέλης. Γίνεται γὰρ δυοῖν ὁνομάτοιν, μεταξδ
τίκτοντος, πληθυντικοῦ priuatos.

Ἔνθα μὲν εἰς Ἀχέροντα Πυριφλεγέθων τε ῥέουσι

Consult Valckenaer’s note on the Grammarian. Regarding Pa·¹
lamedes, to whom the Haoooi, with other more valuable inventione,¹
are attributed, see Suidas v. Παλαμήδης, Ναυπλίου rai Κλιμένης,
Ἀργεῖος. ’
V· 194. Every edition that I have seen has τέκε, although the
verse requires the augment
v. 197. All the copies have ἡδοναῖς δίσκου κεχαρημένον. 1'
ought to have written ἀδοναῖς, Dorice. But the participle κε-
χαρημένος, though it may be found in the Homeric Hymn to
Bacchus, and in the last verse of an Idyll attributed to Theocritus
(xxm), seems to be absolutely abhorrent from the language of
Tragedy. But even if we suppose that Euripides could have used such ¹
a word, yet κεχαρημένος would not have been synonymous with
τερπόμενον, and we can have no doubt that there is a reference
here to tha Homeric Δι’σκοισιυ τέρποντο. If the reader will con-
sider this passage attentively, ‘he will agree with me in thinking
κεχαρημένος to be the introduction of some transcriber or corrector,
as the substitute for a word which was obliterated,¹ or which he
did not understand. This opinion is strengthened by the word
δονακοτρόφου, which concludes the corresponding strophio v. 175,
and with the matre of which the interpolated word was intended to
agree ; but the actual discordance of the verse contributas to hetray
tha forgery, δονακοτρόφου beinga choriambus. with the first syl-
labie resolved. What was really written hy the Poet, is open to any
reader to conjecture; -but it certainly rwassome trissyllable‚ υυ -,
terminating a uncam Polyrchemctirtns. The word κάτοχον in
the margin is not obtruded upon the readers 1 merely mean to
say that Euripides might have used this word, and that it suits
