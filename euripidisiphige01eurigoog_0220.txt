this play the active tense ἔμηνε, 101 1110 1100 01 which he has,l
believe, the authority of only one place, Ion. 520.1 Then the con-
jecture that Ἀφροδίτη had been written over μακάρων τις as an
explanationis, to say the least, exceedingly void 01 probability

pointed out the correction: he observedst ‘By reading Ελληνικῶν,
we may improve the sound 01 11110 verse, certainly without any
