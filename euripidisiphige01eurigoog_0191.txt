after an imperative, νυν ia always enclitic; in νῦν 6η or 6η νυν
with an indicative, it always3 bears the meaning 06 time. See Dr
Monk‚ Hippolyt. 233. νῦν 66060 opor ῥλῖσΗ erra Αθηροε Πόθον

ελεγον, and on Gorg. p. 7. Καί ’γοίρ 6η νυν οὖτα ταντα
ἐπηγγελλόμην. As a general rule we may remark, that νυν,
when it is placed after the verb, is almost always an 00016ῑὶ0.η

v. 913. Aldus and the other old Edd. have Πείθωμεθ aira
πατέρα βέλτιον φρονεῖν. Scaliger and Reiske proposed πείθω-
nov: this is confirmed by the MSS. which vary between πείθωμεν,
πείθομεν, and πείθομεθ with πείθωμεν interlined. cirre re.
mained in the text, Ι believe, till Matthiae altered it to αὖθις.
But that word would at all events be useless to the sentence. '1
have by the change of a letter given αὐτῆς, which seems almost
necessary: Achilles could hardly apply to Agamemnon the word
πατέρα, except in a sentence where some mention or allusion wss
made to his daughter.

v. 915 All editions have Αλλ οι λόγον ys καταπαλαίουσιν
λόγους Although no difficulty has hitherto been started about
the article used with λόγον, yet it appears to me not only unne-
cessary, but destructive 06 the sense. As Achilles means to express a
proverbial truth, Ihave not hesitated to alter ol into oiv,which'1s
an appropriate particle· and the use of rys aster ἀλλ” ουν, another
word being interposeds rs habitual with the Tragedians.

v. 916. Commonly τί ds χρη με 6ρᾷν, rn violation of the
metre. Reiske and Markland, ο τι 60 εχρη Scaliger χρεώ for
χρή. Hermann χρεών, which 1 have adopted.

v. 918 Αν6 α’ντιβαίνη vulgo Markland prefers ην 6 αντ.
propter sonum, eujus in his rebus magna habenda ert ratio. A
better reason might be urged in favour of the change, that dv is
not used by Attio writers simply for e'a'v.

v. 919. Aldus and other editors give Ei ’γάρ rvi χρῇζον
ε’πίθετ, which rs evidently corrupt. The MSS. however have
distinctly’' ειη Ὑθρ, thereby showing the origin of the corruption:
the Aldine appears to have changed* ειη into εί on account of the
metre 1 conceive therefore that the original reading was και dri,

for let ur suppose, and that* ειη ycip, being superscribed as the
interpretation, was in process of time taken into the text in place
