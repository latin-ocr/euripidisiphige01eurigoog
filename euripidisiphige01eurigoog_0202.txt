lPHlGENlA IN AULIS. 171

with the impropriety of her commencing a regular speech in the
midst of her tears and agitation, and he therefore suspected the
lines to have been borrowed from some lost Tragedy. Matthiae,
after much balaneing, agrees with this theory; he objecta to giving
the lines to Clytaemnestra, in whose mouth they are perfectly ap-
propriate, and who had just intimated her determination to speak
at length, because having once made an exordium she does not
proceed till aster much interruption. But this very interruption
shows the art and judgment of the Tragedian, and increases the
pathos and interest of the scene. The Vict. MS. assigna them
to Clytaemnestra, so does Hermann, and as l learn from his note,
others have recently done the same.

After these lines there follows one of the Interpolator's, Κάν
ὑστάτοισι, κᾶν μέσοισι πανταχοῦ, to which the Editors have
in vain laboured to give any rational meaning, although no one
of them seems to have doubted its integrity. This intrusion at
such a moment is more than usually offensive. The author of
thelina seems to have misunderstood that which precedes, ἅπασι

’γὰρ πρώτοισι χρήσασθαι πάρα, and to have thought that some-
thing more was wanted to comprise all the complaints 'of the
speaker. The truth is this: it is common at the commencement
of an oration to express hesitation as to what subject shall have
precedence‚ as Agamemnon says in v. 365. ἄρξομαι πόθοις
Here Clytaemnestra does the same; What, says she, shall 1 tale

v. 1022. Ti δ’ ἐ’στιν; ὥς μοι πάντες εἷς ἓν ἥκετε, Eri-y·
χυσιν ἔχοντες καὶ ταμαιγμὸν ὀμμάτων] Markland takes away
the interr. after ’ἔστιν; and translates vl d* ἔστιν ὥς, Quid vero
est quare, &o But there is no fault in the common punctuation ς
ὥς μοι πάντες &c is an exclamation, πάντες implying Cly.
taemnestra‚ Iphigenia, and the attendants who are supposed to
accompany the latter out of the house.

ι v. 1024. E'c'tp’ ’ἂν ἐρωτήσω σε γενναίως,Ι πόσι] The
translations have qnoe te interrogabo. ἐρωτήσω is not the future,

but the aorist subjunctive: Potter's version is more scholerlike, “
