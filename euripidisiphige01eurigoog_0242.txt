either by arguments o priori, or by the examples 1(1(1((00(1,111(11 the
Tragic poeta did generally compose those parts called κόμμο( in
antistrophic arrangement. Α1 rn each song particular descriptione
01 verse ⁸usually predominate, it happens that there 1s frequently
found 1 resemblance of measure for two or three lines together in
different parts of the same melody. But this is a poor reason for
doing violence 10 the language of other lines, for the sake of realia-
ing an ideal correspondence of metre, which when effected, conveys
neither harmony to the ear, nor satisfaction to the understanding.
.lt does not seem probable that the Poet would take the trouble of
making a portion of the concluding song 01 the Chorus, after
Iphigenia's final exit, correspond exactly in metre with 1 part 01
her 11111111 and their responses. The result of such antistrophiring
labours is that we obtain licentious forms 01 Dochmiac measure,
instead 01 easy and harmonicus lines of the common species ; that
we have such antistrophic parings as, 101 γᾶ μᾶτερ with κλεινό-
τατον στέφανον( 01, δώσομεν ἁμέτερα with Ἀχαιῶν θέλων.
Ι may add that many other arrangements, besides the two men·
tioned, might be devised with an cqual show of probability3 and
it seldom happens that among the advocates of such schemen, any
two are found to agree exactly upon the words or even the limita
of the respective stanzas.

These lines, as they are now arranged, consist for the most part
of trochaice and iambics, with the interposition 01 some cretics. The
first verse like 1388, 1398. is that called Periodio Catol. having one
iambic dipodia followed by a troch. monom. catal. lt rs not un-
frequent rn tragic songs, in which, as here, iambic and trochaic
verses are intermixed.
