v. 973. ’Ότλων Ηφαιστοπόνων Κεκορυθμόνοκ ενδντΗ εκ
Oeae ματρός δωρήματ’ ἔχων] As the Homeric participle here
adopted, κεκορυθμένος, 1s always used m Homer with a dative,
Schaefer (on Bos p. 467) suggests doubtfully, that the preposi-

tion υπδ is understood before ὅπλων, si tamen hic aliquid sub- ¹

audiendam. However plain the meaning, it cannot be denied
that there' rs some ambiguity' ιιι the construction of this sentence.

Wheuever κεκορ. is applied by Homer to a person, it is in
the phrase κεκορυθμένος αἴθοπι χαλκῷ, helmstad raith briglrt
brass,· and ἕνδυτα (οι rather ἑυδυτυῖ) the covers'ng, ought, according
to the usage of our Author, to be joined with ὅπλων. See Elms-
ley on Bacch 745. lt would seem then that the order of the
words' ιιι construction is, ἔχων ἕνδυτοὶ χρυσέων ὅπλων Ηφαι-
στοπόνωυ (δωρήματα εκ θεᾶς ματρός Θέτιδος) κεκορυθμένος
scil. κόρυθι Ηφαιστοιιόνιρ. ΑΗ difficulty will cesse if, instead
of κεκορυθμένος, we suppose και κόρυθος ιο be read m the context;
for the participle seems to be the representative of those two words.

v. 978. lustead of γάμον Hermann gives γάμων.

ν. 979. Commonly Νηρηιδοκ Herm. Νηρῆδόι τ. Ihave
adopted Νηρηδων, the emendation of Heath. “Pro anyrdos
'conjicerem cum Heathio Νηρῄδων, ut δαίμονα πρῶτον μακάρων,
Bacch 377. et Αχιλλέα πρῶτον Ελλαδος Andr. 1237. Primis
ardis, Horat. Epist. 1. 20. 23.” Markland. ·

v. 981. Σε δ επὶ κάρα Στέψουσι καλλικόμαν Πλόκαμου
Ἁργειοι] Markland writes,‘ ‘Sequitur Σε δ επι κόρα &c quasi
dixisset, tales ειανι Thetidis nuptia: Τιι vero, OIplsigcm'a, coro-
naberis, non ut sponsa, sed ιιι victima. Hic est sensus satis pla-
nus: sed constructionem et versionem non praestabo istorum,
ἑτι κάρα στέψουσι καλλικόμαν τλόκαμουθ There is not the
least difficulty ιιι either‘ construction’ or ‘version' στέψουσι
has aster it two accusatives, σε and πλόκαμον, asyntax of the
commoneat nature both' m Greek and Latin. The reader may
however be surprised at the abruptness of ιΙιε transition by
which Iphigenia is now addressed. I suspect that something has
been lost from the beginning of this Epode, and that the first
words have been rubbed off, or destroyed by damp: a sus-
picion corroborated by the metre of v. 981. od δ’ ἐπὶ κόρα,
which sounds like the latter half of a Glyconean, as if it had
been written oi δύστηνε, σε’ δ ἐπὶ κόρα, οι ὦ τόλαινα-,
