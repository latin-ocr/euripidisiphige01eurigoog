100 NOTES ΟΝ THE

is, Ἀλλ’ ε’·γοί ’γνοιίς πρόσθεν ου’κ εὖ, μετεθὲμην εὐβουλίαν·
Μαίνομαι;

v 313. η6ε”γ ἑλπίς,ο1μαιμεν,θεος Κιίξὲπραξεναντό etc]
Matthiae conjectures ἦγε 6 Ελπίς But the common reading rs
in every way preferable, ην being suppressed: so in Cycl. 316
Ο πλοῦτος, ἀνθρωπίσκε, τοῖς σοφοῖς θεός. Compare Virg.

AEn.rx.185. an ενα cuique deus fit dira cupido? Then‚ Aldus has
ε’ξεπραξεν, but the Paris and Victorian MSS. κάξέπραξεν

v. 315. The common readrng Oris λαβῶν orpdreoery οἶμαι
6 ειση μωρίᾳ φρενῶν, rs repugnant both to the metre and the
sense. Two Paris MSS. omit‘y'· Ihope that my emendation has

restored a corrupt line, with a very small change of one or two
letters, ονς λαβών στροίτεν· ἕτοιμοι 6 εισί.

v 316. This verse has been lost from our copies of Euripides;
but it' rs preserved by Theophilus Antioch. p. 258. and Stobaeus
xxvrrr. p. 123 Grot. cites the passage.

v. 317. κατηναγκασμενους Stobaeus; and so Musgr.

v 318. καί τὸ oda μεν el Παριί dirasduras, κακίστης

εννί6ος τιμωρία] Iph. T. 584 το 6 εν μαλισταὙ’ dde' γιγνεται.
AEsch. Ag. 119 τ66 ευ νικατω. The old reading περα 6ίκης
is inconsistent with the measure. παροῖ is the correction of Reiske.

Hermann has edited κοὺ το adv μὲν ευ and τιμωρίᾳ, both which
1 consider to be changes for the worse

v. 320. Ἐμε de συντήξουσι νυκτες ημέραι τε 6ακρυοις]
Homer 11. Ω. 714. ινκτας τε καί ἤματα δακρυχέουσα.

v. 321. Vulgo ε’γείναμεν, voa nihili. Markland restored ε”γει-
ναμην, which rs found' 1n some MSS, but he was wrong m affixing
a note of' interrogation to the line.

v. 323. Eid εμη βουλει φρονεῖν’ εν, ταμ’ εγω θήσω καλῶς]
So Ald and MSS. Markland wished to change εν into ov: but

although his alteration has met with the approbation of Porson and
the adoption of Gaisford, 1 consider the common reading to be correct

v. 326. All the editions that l ever saw give φίλους ἄρ’ οὐχί
κεκτήμην τάλας. But not to mention the rejection of the augment,
the pluperfect rs here quite out of place. Elmsley’s correction
(Heracl. 283) )φίλους αν ουχί κεκτημην, does not sound to me
naturad or probable, and 1 think the sentence requires κέκτημαι.
Some editors make this verse interrogative, and 1 intended to,
have done the same.
