IPlllGIlNlA IN AULIS 191

jure the measure, which' rs Troehaic, and whether weresd ὤφελεν
or ιοφελες ιιι v. 1186, they embarrass the construction.

v.1182. Cretic dim. smetreoften intermixed with Trochaic.

v lisa 11αἶος,11αἶος] This line consiste of two Anubacchrac

feet, like 1201. ὠ μᾶτερ, ὠ μᾶτερ.

’ v. 1186. commonly μήποτ ὤφειλε. The Trocbaic mette
plainly shows that either ὤφελες οι ὤφελεν should be substi-
1ιι1ο1ι Elmsley gives the former, Hermann the latter. 11 we con·
sider the song to begin withan address to Mount Ida (which rs
the more spirited and poetical idea) we shall read ὤφελες, par- ’
ticularly from the great resemblance of the following parallel
placem Phoen. 814 Ὠ ζαθέων πετάλων πολυθηρότοτον vanos,
Ἀρτέμι1ος χιονότροφον onata Κιθαιρῶν, Μήποτε τᾶν θανάτῳ
προτιθέντι, λόχενμ 1οκοῖσται, ”oprtet 011 smil αν θρέψοι
βρέφος ἔκβολον οιιιων See also Soph. OEd. T. 1391. But if any
readers think that a sentence of' rnvocation ought to have began
with the interjection ω, and prefer making νάπος ι nominative,
they will adopt ωφελεν

v. 1187. All the copies have the word Ἀλέξαν1ρον following
this line; but 11 plainly belongs to the interpolator, who seems to
have thought that as it contained two of the names of the royal
peasant, Paris and Idaeus, the line would be more complete if it
had all three· his liberality has caused much embarrassment to the
metrica] flow of the verses. Seidler writes dsspods'ar', Elmsley
παῖ1 Ἀλέξαν1ρον ssione, and Hermann makes the unmanageable
nemeto constitute a verse by itself. Monk seems to have been
sensible of the intrusion‚ as he incloses the word' ιιι brackets.

v. 1188. The scene of the Judgment of Paris is similarly
described in v. 178. ἐπὶ κρηναίαισι δρόσοις, arrd in Helen. 682.
λοντρων sol speccialiter Osci μορφὰν ἑφα11ρνναν.

These follow two lines which 1 have placed at the foot of the
page, as having been interpolated: hal goddess ἄνθεα inivensi
τε Ocalea 1ρέπειν. The words may have been taken out of some
poem on the Judgment of Paris: the marks of intrusiveness are
glaring, particularly when we consider that they follow the descrip-
tion of the ground, λειμών τ’ ἄνθεσι θάλλων χλωροῖς. But
their metro, their language‚ and their dialect all concur in convicting
them: the mention of roses and hyacinths for tlte goddesses lo ploos,
comes before any notice of the goddesses themselves. and the word
podosvra betrays the forgery, as Euripides would have said ῥο1έα.
