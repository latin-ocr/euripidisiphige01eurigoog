construction is similar to that 01 Hipp. 1011. Kal σοῦ ‘ys κάρτα

118. Otr arri radoin σ’ ἐφύτενσ ἀγαθοῖς, Ἀγάμεμνον,
· 'ihr-pion] Hipp. 461. χρῆν σ dari ῥητοις ἄρα Πατερα φυ-
τεύειν. Plutarch twice quotes this passage 01 the Iphigenia, p. 33.
Ε. and p 108. Β. Stobaeus has ἔφυς· for aspirano.

ν. 31. Το1 θεῶν’ curu βονλόνιεν ἔσται] Instead 01 the two
last words Stoboeus quotes νενόμισται, which Barnea and other
editors have printed' ιιι the text: this word rs appropriate enough,
and 1 paroemiac is natrrral attha conclusion 01 the Old Man's
moralizing. still there rs no doubt but that Euripides wrote what
is found ιιι Aldus and the Manuscripts, and was read hy Plutarch,
and that Stobaeus' memory deceived him. τα θεῶν βουλόμενα,

the will ofthe Goda. See v. 1165. 0111 επ1τόκε1νονβοινλο-
μενον έλήλνθα.

κατέγραφεν Γ ηρυς The accusative is also confirmed by σφρα-
γίζεις and λύεις which follow. Some think that Ovid had thia

passage in his memory, when he wrote (Met. rx. 5111) Dentre tenet
ferramentum tenet attero cerum. Incipit 1111111011 scribit dom·
