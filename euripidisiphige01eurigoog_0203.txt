κέλευσμ’ ού δεῖ ’γ” ε’. θ. the other ού δεῖ ’γ’ ε’. θ. both which
readings exhibit attempta to give a new and affected turn to a
plain sentence. Canter properly edited κελευσμοῦ. Markland pro-
posed δεῖμ’, as Reiske had done before him (though the latter
considered μ’ as an clided μοι) and this reading meets the appro-
bation of Porson ,and of Hermann. But I have no doubt that
instead of δεῖ ’γ’ Euripides wrote δεῖ α’. Clytaemnestra had ex-
horted Agamemnon to give a sincere answer‚· he replies, Yoa
have ιιο need to use exhortatione. This is the reading of Dobree.

v. 1026. See note ou v· 775· .

v. 1027. Ἔα. τλήμονά τ’ ἔλεξας, ὑπονοεῖς θ’ d μή σε
χρή] Every copy has τλήμονά γ’, which I have on my own
responsibility altered to τλήμονά τ’. My reason is two-fold;
, ist the particle γε, when used in thi‘s sort of' dialogue, has
generally the force of assent, which would here be unsuitable to
the sense. adly, though the expressions δεῖν’ ἔλεξας, θαύμαστ’
ἔλεξας, ’γενναῖ’ ’ἔλεξας &e are common in the tragic dialogusr,
yet I do not recollect ’γε ever being attached to them.

v. 1028. The words ἔχ’ ἥσυχος are wanting in all the editions
before Markland, who found them in the MSS. Elmsley on
Med. 537. cites other instances of the same phrase; and on
Soph. OEd. Col. 315. gives several examples in which one or
two words arc interposed in the Iambic dialogus of the Trage-
dians, as distinct lines.

v. 1030. The old edd. have εἰκότα κλύεις, against both pro
sody and construction. Markland restored εἰκότ’ ἂν κλύοιςε
the latter word is in the margin of Barnes’ text. ·

v. 1031. Aldus has οὒκ, ἀλλ’ ἐρωτῶ, i. e. minime, sed intera
rogo. Canter ούκ,’όι’λλ’ ε’. micinae, alia interrogo. Barnea prints
it correctly, ούκ ἄλλ’ ε’. aon olio interrogo.

v. 1032. Ιῐι the old editions this line is thus dislocated‚

d πότνια τύχη, καὶ μοῖρα, καῖ’ δαίμων ’γ’ dude.

'l'he credit. of the restoration is due to Musgrave. 'The Mss:
which fluctuate, all tend to confirm this reading. Porson’s note
is, “ MS. apud Musgravium dolator τ’, qui optime legit Ὦ τότ-
νια μοῖρα, καῖ τύχη, δαίμων τ’ ἐμός. Frustra Heathius et
Marklandus legunt πότνα, quae vox scenae prorsus ignota est.
Idem MS. delet καῖ ante δαίμων.”

v. 1033. Κόμύκ γε, καὶ τῆσδ, , εἷς’ τριῶν δυσδαιμόνων]
