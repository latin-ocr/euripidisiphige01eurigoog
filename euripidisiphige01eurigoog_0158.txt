hedit not met with the applauae of Hermann, and been by him
introduced into the text.

v. 594. σε’ dd reponsorium τάδε, Λήδας γε’νεθλον, εί
κατῳκτίσθην ίίγαν] Suidas explains παραιτεῖσθαι by συγγνοί-
νην αίτεῖν. Markland entertained a notion of placing a comma after
παρ. and making the order of the words, εί κατῳκτίσθην rdd .
This appears to be a most awkward inversion of the sentence: it
has however found an approver and follower in Hermann. 1 can
see no objection to the construction of παραιτοῦμαι σί τάδε,

i. e. an accusative of the person and an accusative of the thing.
v. 600. Commonly πείσεσθαι ds' με. The correction is Mat.

thiae's. In the following line, Καῦτῆν δόκει reid, (ὥστε uri od
νουθετεῖν) all editions have κη’ σε. 1 consider that some emphasis
on this pronoun is necessary.

v. 603. Ἀλλ’ ὁ νόμος οὗτοί τῷ χρόνῳ ξυνισχαυεῖ] Aldus
συνισχοίνει. 'l'he MSS. συνανίσχεται. Musgravc gives σννισχνά-
νει. Gaisford restored the Aldine. But Matthiae is correct in
writing συνισχανεῖ. Porson (on Orest. 292.) expresses his belief
that the form ίσχαίνιν was preferred by the Attice, as being more
agreeable to the ear than ίσχναίνω. Hermann however agrees with
the Quarterly Reviewer Vol. 111. p. 393. in preferring σννισχναυεῖ.

v. 604. Τοίίνομα μὲν οῦν naid οἷδ’ ὅτῳ κατῄνεσας] Person
(on Orest. 1090) is of opinion that the verb καταινεῖν is used
only in speaking of the father or guardian of the bride, who was
termed d scriptos, alleging the present verse, and comparing v. 612
of this Play, Zedr ἠγγύησε, καί didwo’ ὁ κύριος(

v. 605. Γ ε’νουε de* arcion, χώπόθεν, μαθεῖν θέλω] Por-son
writes γε’νουε d ὁποίου· If any change vere to be made, 1 should
prefer καί πόθους but it is not necessary.

v. 606. Αίγινα θυγάτηρ ἐγένετ’ Ἀσωποῦ πατρός] Aldus
ἔγείνατ’, which Canter correcte.

v. 607. commonly ίζευξί τιο; but it evidently should be
ἔζευξε τίς; and thus, according to the statement of Matthiae, it was
conected by Lenting.

v. 608. Brodaeus and subsequent commentatore referto Schol. ,
ad Hom.11.B.562. Οί τ’ ἔχον Αίγιναν, νῆσον πρῦ τῆς Ἀττικῆς·
ἐκαλεῖτο δὲ πρότερον Οίναίνη, ὕστερον le* Αἴγινα, dard Αἰγίνης,
τῆς Ἀσωποῦ adv θυγατρός, Αίακοῦ dd μητρός. see pind„-

Isthm. v. 44. Ἀλλ’ a'v Οίνοίνᾳ μεγαλήτορες ὀργαί Αἰακοῦ
