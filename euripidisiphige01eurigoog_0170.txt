no need of conjectures in this matter. The elision'of the ι is de-

ν. 714. Γῆυ ’γοίρ λιποίν Φάρσαλον, videi Πηλέα] Such was
the reading of Aldus and all other editions, until Markland in-

troduced the adjective Φαρσάλιον, from some Mss.; and as the

second syllable is long, he thought that we ought to pronounce
the word Φαρσᾶλρον, a sort of contraction unknown to Attio

Greek. Porson (Praef. Hec. p. 22.) points out this error.

v. 715. Μίνω ’πί λεπταῖς ταισίδ’ Εὐρίπου ῥοαῖς] The com-
mon reading is ταῖσδέ ’γ’ Εὐρίπου πνοαῖς. Markland suggests
ῥοαῖς, with these observatione: “I-Iae λεπταί Εὐρίπου ῥοαί νο,
cantur λεπτδς Εὐρίπου rnoldo apud Strabon, Ι. p. 102. ex lone
chio. Credo Euripidem scripsisse ῥοαῖς, alterum esse ab interpo-
latore qui meminerat πνοὰς a Graecis hoc tempore expectari.'' Ι
have adopted this emendation, which is strongly confirmed by the
passage cited from the Tragedian lon, and Bacch. 784. παρ’ Ἀσω-
ποῦ ῥοαῖς. Hermann's ingenious substitution of πύλαις has been
already mentioned. ταισίδ’ for ταῖσδέ ’γ’ is the correction of
Blomlield. The copiers seem to have been very averse to' this
dative, which they continually alter into ταῖσδέ γ’, considering
’γε to be a mere expletive. Ι cannot concur with Hermann in
thinking that ‘ys would have any force in this sentence ; he says,
‘⁶ AEgre morum ferentis hoo ’γε est.''

Ae'yovo’. Porson (Phoen. 1230) expresses his opinion, though

doubtfully, that λε”γουσί με is here used for λε’·γουσί μοι. This η ¹

is a doctrine to which, however high the authority, 1 am slow to
subscribe, and should prefer Markland's suggestion of o‘i τ’. But
my own reading, oi δ’, appears so certain, that although Iam the
first to propound it, 1 shall be surprised if readers accustomed to
the scenio dialogue, do not at once recognise its truth. ol dd, illi autem.
It is needless to cite instances os so common an usage: the reader
may, however, if he pleaseS, compare vv. 76. 335. of this Tra-

seems surprising that so many learned men should have tolerated.
