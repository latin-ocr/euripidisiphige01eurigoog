IPHIGENIA IN AULIS. 99

v. 301. αιματηρὸν ομμα. Τ1111“ 11 translated m common ver-

' siuns, cruentum oculum. It ought to be vudum sanguine persumm-
v 303. λέκτρα χρήστ’ ε’ρᾷς λαβεῖνς] This 11 a restoration

by Heath, instead 01 the common reading λε’κτρ ἐρᾷς cys ¹
χρηστα λαβεῖνς 11 11 surprising that Elmsley should have thought
of reading χρηστῆς 01 (Med 581. note) χρηστῶν. λέκτρα χρησ-
τα 1131111118 donum acorem, as 111 Hipp 631. H χρηστοὶ λέκτρα,
πενθέρουςδ ἀνωφελεῖς Λαβῶν.

v. 305. erl ἐγω δίκην lei ωσῶν κακῶν, ὁ μη σφαλείς· ‚]

This 1s an emendation of Dawes, Miac. crit. p. 841. the old lection
being diane deloco κακῶν. Rufinianus has preserved the' imitation

of this passage by Ennius,
Ego projectum quodie peccas.9 lu delinquis, ego arguor?
Pro malefactis Heleno redeat? uirgo pereat innocens?
Tua reconcilietur acor? mec nocetur filia?

v. 307. ro* λελογισμένον, Angl. discretior. The adverb λε-
λογισμένως 11 found in v. 923.
' v. 309. All editions have Ei δ’ ε’·γώ ‘yrcis πρόσθεν οὐκ εὖ
μετετέθην εὐβουλίᾳ, Mulucham nor am I aware that any editor
or critic has expressed a suspicion of the passage being corrupt
But a Paris Ms. which I collated myaelf, has μετέθην. Iinfer
therefore that the person who wished to correct the measure of
the verse, made a wrong insertion of a syllable, and produced the
word μετετέθην, when he ought 10 have restored μετεθέμην.
The other form will' 111 vain be sought 101· 111 the Tragic writings,

nor would it equally well suit the meaning. We must also read
ἐν’βονλίαν The same construction ο1 μετεθεσθαι rs found m

011111111Ταχ111 δὲ μετέθου λνσσαν, apricos φρονῶν, which
Poraon renders, insanium sanitate mulcati, observing that the con-
structionis one familiar to Horace But even these alterations
do not entirely remove the faults ο1 this sentence. I 11111111 that
Euripides would not have said Ei 11 e'yai ’γνους πρόσθεν ουκ
eu, but uri εν. Itis true thatin 0111111171 Aldus has Εἴ
ποθεν ἄελπτος παραπέσοι σωτηρία Κτανονσιν, οὑ devoror:

but there the Scholiast reads κτανουσι, μη θανονσι, audac 110
the greater part ο1 the Mss„ and 1ο 11 11 printed in recent editions.
Since therefore the mode ο1 speaking in v. 413. ’Ἀλλ’ 111 μετα-
βολοῖς ἦλθον (1πὸ δεινῶν λόγων, seems to correspond with that
in the line before us, Ι have judged that 1111Ι true reading here
