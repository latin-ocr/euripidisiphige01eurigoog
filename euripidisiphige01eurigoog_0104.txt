ort THE

IPHIGENIA IN AULIS.

v. 4. Fon 11111001, Ρο11011 proposed to read σπεῦδε, and others ·
have followed himin this suggestion; the answer of the Old Mau,

σπεύδω, does sound like a reply 10 σπεῦδε, asin ν.,2 στεὶχω
11 10 στεῖχε.

v. 5. Μάλα τοι ’γῆρας 1011μό1 ονπνον, Καὶ επ ’ὄφθολμοῖ1
11ξῦ πάρεστιν] 10 γῆρας, the reading of Aldus aud the MSS.
has continued m the editions until lately: τοι 11 in the margin of
Barnes, and appears 10 have been his own correction. Some com·
mentators have made needless difficulties in explaining this and
the following line 3 they may be rendered almost literally, My
old age 11 very slecpless, 01111111 malesei upon my eyes.

v. 6. Ε11111111, who translated 0111· Tragedy of Euripides, gives
the following version of this passage:

Aean. Quid nocti' videtur 111 altisono
· Coelr' clypeo?
Senex. Temo superat stellas, cogens
Sublime 0110111 atque etiam 1100111
Itiner.
The above lines are cited by Varro (Liag. Lat. Lib. 6) without the ¹
name of the author. Scaliger discovered them 10 be Ennius’s,
and from another passage of Varro (Lib. 4) corrected altisono for
altissimo. It hence also appears that the question of Agamemnon
does not end, as rt 11 commonly quoted, with Quid 110011 videtur?

v. 8. Σείριος, εγγύς τῆς ἑπτοπορου Πλοιαδος” αισσων ἔτι
μεσσήρης] Οοι11ρ111001011.1001.Επταπορου re δρόμημο
Πελειάδος. Most of the commentatore, from Scaliger downwards‚
have remarkcd the error of Euripides 111 placing Sirius near the
Pleiades Boeckh (de Graec. Trag. p. 277) observes,‘ ‘Ubi Sirius
in summo eoelo 011, (μεσσήρης) Vergiliae supra horizonta positae sunt

gradibus 503⁸ Matthia says, “Non mirer si Euripides Sirium cum

splendida stella quae est in fronte Tauri, Aldebcran vocant, confuderit.”
