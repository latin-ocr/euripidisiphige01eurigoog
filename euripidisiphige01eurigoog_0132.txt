IPHIGENIA IN AULIS. 101

v. 388. Δείξεις de εποῦ μοι πατρὸς ἐκ πανποῖι ’γεγώς ;]
Professor Monk illustrates this construction on Alcest. 779· Com-
pare particularly Med. 548 Εν τῷδε δείξω πρῶτα μεν σοφός
Ὑειγῶι.

. ν. 339. All the copies of our Poet give us instead of this verse,
a very different one, Σνσσωφρονεῖν ‘yoip βουλομ dna οὗ σνν-
νοσεῖν. This elision of the diphthong rs of course not to be
tolerated. All the efforts of scholars to amend the line would have
proved unsatisfactory, but by good fortune Plutarch has preserved
the genuine verse. he quotes (p. 64 C.) )σνσσωφρονεῖν ’γὰρ ονχῖ
συννοσεῖν ἔφυ. It appears then that' some corrector of this Tragedy,
offended by a construction which he did not understand, altered the
words rnto others better suited to his comprehension. Porson pointed
out the passage of Plutarch from which the verse of the Poetis re-
covered. The same construction is found ιιι Soph. Phil. 88. Εφνν

’γὰρ otides εκ τέχνης πράσσειν κακῆς. Antig. 688. Σοὶ d ονν

· πέφυκα πάντα προσκοπεῖν, et alibi

v. 333 Ελλᾶς δὲ σνν σοὶ sacci θεῶν νοσεῖ τινα] θεῶν
instead of dedu is the reading of Person, who adduces many similar
passages of the TragedianS, in which they prefer saying θεῶν τις
rather than θεός res.

v. 334. Σκήππρῳ ννν αὔχει, σόν κασίγνητον προδούς] αὐχεῖς
Ald. A worse corruption was introduced into this line in the second
edition of Hervagius,ui1v,in open opposition to the measure.
Tyrwhitt rightly suspected that we ought to read ανχει, not
αὐχεῖς. It may be remarked that the enclitic νυν is very seldom
used with indicatives, but perpetually with imperatives and opta-
tives. The translations render σον κασίγνητον προδοιῖς by prodens
taum fratrem it ought to be tao fratre deserto.

v. 337. Hermann truly observes that the hasty entrance of the
Mcssenger, interrupting the conversation of Agamemnon and Mene-
laus, is represented by the commencement of his speech being in the
middle of a verse. He compares the Philoctetes of Sophocles v. 974.
where Ulysses appearing οιι a sudden, begins' ιιι the middle of a
verse, oi κάκισπ ’dudpww τι ’δρᾷι; Ιιι Τιο. 415. Agamemnonis
stiled Οιγαῖρ με’·γισπος τῶν Πανελλήνων ἅναξ, Ἀτρέως φιλας
παῖς.

ν. 339. Aldus givesle Ἰφιγένειαν ὠνόμασας ποτ’ ἐν δόμοις,
a line with an anapaest for the fourth foot. 1 can testify that the
