118 ’ noras on vnn

v. 609. 'f οῦ δ’ «Αἰακοῦ ταῖς τίς κατέσχε δώματα t] Elmsley
tells ns that we ought to write vd δ Αἰακοῦ, and Matthiae approves
the injunction. With all deference to such authority, I hold the
received text to be right. AEacus, being now named for the second
time, is as much entitled 'to have his article, as his son Peleus is in

. the next line, Πηλεύς· ὁ Πηλεδς δ ἔσχε Νηρέως κόρην.
ν. 611. Θεοῦ διδόντος, ἦ βίᾳ θεῶν belluim] In these words

there is no variation among the ancient copies; but to modern
scholare θεῶν has given great offence. Markland wishes to substi-
tute for it, θεοῦ. Porsen writes the following note in his copy of
Markland: θεδν legendum. θεῶν ert absurdum, θεοῦ tautologum.

Both these great scholare have here spoken hastily3 nor is Elmsley
more successful when he proposes, τίνος (leddarum No alteration

is necessary, the sense of the line being Dedilae pater Deus? an
Diis invitis horno duait dum? The reader may, if he pleases,
place a mark of interrogation aller διδόντος1

ν. 613. Γαμεῖ δὲ τοῦ νιν; ἦ κατ’ οἶδμα πόντιονς] lt is

commonly read ἢ κατ’ οἶδμα πῦντιονς whence Elmsley reads

τοῦ ’γῆς1 see his note on Soph. OEd. Col. 66. and 1623. Barnes
properly gives ἦ, but without apprising the render of the change,
and he is followed by recent editors. “Gravior quoestio est, et
mirantis si factum est quod non credibile videatur.” Hermann.

v. 614. Aldus Πηλείον, which is corrected by Canter.

v. 615. ιρκὶσθαι is the emendation of Porson, in place of the
common lection, οἰκεῖσθαι. See v. 571.

v. 616. ἔδαισαν γάμους. The same phrase occurs in vv. 122.
629. of this Tragedy.

v. 618. Χείρων, ἵν’ ἤθη uri μάθοι κακῶν βροτῶν] Vulgo
μάθῃ. Musgrave properly gives μα’θοι, on account of the past
tense ἔθρεψεν.

v. 619. Φεῦ. σοφός θ’ 6 θρέψας, χιῦ dederis σοφώτερος]
φεῦ, entra metrum, is here an expression of admiration and applause,
as in v.879. lhave written σοφός θ’, instead of the common reading

ισοφθς γ’. The latter particle can have no force in this line.

v. 624. Vulgo Keivrp μελήσει ταῦτα, τῷ κεκτημένῳ. Her-

mann gives, as an emendation, κείνην, and is perhaps right in so
doing.
v. 625. Ald. εῦτνχείτην. The error was corrected by Portus.
