unionum nt sums. 128

λέγεις, Ι don't understand what you ure talking about—im. what
you meon. But let us suppose that some annotator had written in
the margin of his copy the arnapasstio dipodia οὐκ old ii τι φῆς,
as a parallel expression which he remembered in some other
Tragedy, and a transcriber ol that copy taking this to be the
beginning of the verse, produced such a line as the following,
οὐκ etl ὁ τι φῆς, οὑκ olda, φίλταθ’ [ὅ τι λέγεις οὗ] μοι, πάτερ.
'l'he person who undertook to reduce the line into what he con·
oeived to be legitimate measure, would be very likely to cut out
the words inclosed in brackets, and hence might be produced
such a verse as that which holds its place in Euripides. In a
case like the present, where there are no data for restoring the
genuine text, 1 wish to he understood as speaking without the
least confidente in my conjecture3 it is merely intended to shew
in what way the corruption of the text might hare been occasioned.
Hermann, on the contrary, fancies that he has reduced the verse
into sueh a form as defles all exception on the score of correct
diction or poetical usage. His text has it,
οὑκ otla' α’ ὅ τι (pris, φίλτατ’ οὐκ oiri, ὦ πάτερ.

But alas! this amended line is no more faultless than that which
it supersedet. 1 admit that the Greeks frequently say otlo' se
ὅστις el, ὅστις ἥκεις, ὅστις λέγειν, &ez but 1 am not yet
satisfied that they could say olid oe ὅ τι φὴς instead ol olda

ὅ τι αὖ φής. ln the next place, d πάτερ situated at the end

of the verse aster along syllable, violatas the practice of the
Tragedians. See Elmsley's note on the Medea v. 326„

v. 563. huiusne νῦν ἐροῦμεν] This is found in most of the
MSS. Aldus derisere μὲν γ’. Hermann ἀσύνετά νυν. Butl
doubt whether the euclide νον can properly be joined with a
future verb. 1 have sometimes suspected that we ought to read
θῆτ’ instead of νῦν.

ν. 564. “Hoec verba, παπαῖ, τό σιγᾷν οὑ σθένω, aversus
a lilia dicit. Non enim eam andire vult.” Hermann. Instances
ol the article being used with an inlinitive in cases like the present,
where it is not required hythe sense, are not unfrequent. Soph.
