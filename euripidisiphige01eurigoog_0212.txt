IPHlGENlA IN AULIS. 181

v. 1096. πρό μητρός Scaliger, for πρός μητρός.

v. 1098. commonly παιδός ὑστερῆσομαι. Hermann objects
to ὑστ. as aliquanto debilius vebum, quam quo tio usus videatur
Euripides. lhave a different objection to it: I cannot find this
future ιο have been' ιιι use at all, and ιιι the only instance that 1
recollect of the verb' m the Tragedies, its signification rs of an·
other kind-Phoen. 990. Ην ὑστερήσῃς, οιχόμεσθο, κατθανεῖ
ὑστερεῖσθαι ιιι the sense of ιοιιίις,Ι rs found with a genitive in
prose writers, and particularly m the New Testament, from a

recollection of which passages, l suspect that ιι was introduced
ιιιιο this line. Epist. Rom.' rii. 23. πάντες Ὑοιρ ἥμαρτον, και

- ὑστεροῦνται raico (ιο ’ξηι τοο Θεοῦ. Porson proposed (as Reiske
had done before him) ἐστερήσομαι, and if any authority could
be found for the use of that form of the future, it ought to be
adopted here. But 1 know of no passive future of this verb,
except στερήσομαι. 1 am therefore driven to Markland's emend-
ation, παιιιΗ αποστορήσομιιι. The construction of the accusative,
instead of the genitive, aster στερειν and ιιποστεροιν is not very
common3 but there are instances enough even in the Attio Poets

tojustify its adoption: see Herc F. 137. οιοοι ξυμμάχους-
όποστερήσειι in Xenophon several examples may be found. This
word suits the bitterness of cl tamnestra's expostulation. she may
beimagined about ιο say wuid’ ἀπολῶ, but to substitute, as more
touching, ἀποστ Hermann introduces an emendation of bis own,
παιδός ης στερήσομαι. What induced him ιο believe that our
Poet could use ἧς for ἑμης I do not comprehend.

v. 1099. Aldus has ὑπόστροφον renuldo, but all the MSS
ὑπότροφον. Α great number of conjectures have been hazarded
upon this word3 Scaliger ὑπόροφον, Reiske εὑβόστροχον,
Markland ὑπότροπον, Hermann ὑπόροφον, ιο all of which there
are very strong objections. There remains that of Heath, which
1 have no hesitation in considering the true reading, ὑπότροπος,
radus, reversa, an Homeric word frequently applied to persons
retprning to their country. Od. Y. 332. Ει νόστησ’ Οιιοσιιὺς
και ὑπότροπος ἵκετο (luipo. X. 35. Ω κόνει, οὑ μ sv- ἑφό-
σκεθ ὑπότροπον barud ιιέσθαι Δήμου οπο Τρώιον. The Scho-
lieston Homer explains ὑπότροποι, ἐξ ὑποστροφῆς ἐπανελθών.

lapprehend that this, or some such gloss, written over the word,
gave rise to ὑπόστροφον, from which proceeded ὑπότροφον.
