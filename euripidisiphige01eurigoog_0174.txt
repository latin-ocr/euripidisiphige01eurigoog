opening of the Play and again at v. 224. ὦ, σέ τοι λείγιο rs Mark
land's emendation for ως σε’ τοι λέγω.

v. 759. Tit ο καλῶν, πυλας παροίξαςς] Musgrave renders
παρ. paullulum apericus. One Paris MS. has ἀνοίξαις but with
παρ superscribed.

ν 760. commonly Aouhos οὐχ ἁβρύνομαι τῷδ’· ἡτῦχη
’γαρ μ Οὐκ ἕᾷ One Paris MS. has ἡ τυχη ’γᾶρ οὐκ ἑᾷ,
omitting μ, and so Elmsley would read, ιιι order to obtain an
Iambus instead of a Spondee. The same might be done by sub-
stituting ol μ’ ἑᾷ. Itis not quite clear that the ears of the Tra-
gedians repudiated a measure of that description. See Elmsley on
Med. 703. and tn Auctario. But m the verse of the Alcest. 1083.
which he compares with ours, mm ερως τίς μ ἐξάγει, there are
somewhat stronger metrical objections to retaining the μ. The
reader may see by his note οιι Med. 326. to what a much greater
extent he¹ rs disposed to carry Porson's Canon respecting the fifth
foot of a denarius, than was contemplated by its author. Generally
speaking, 1 think that any alterations of the text, made without
authority to follow out such views, would be unwarrantable. In ,
the present case however l am justified ιιι omitting the pronoun,
as is done' ιιι one manuscript copy.

ιι. 762. Τῆσδε της πάροιθεν οικων ,Tuudnipewdou‘ros πατρός]
The editions before Musgrave's have ‘illude των rapodo* οικων.
But the MSS. preserve the true reading τῆσδε της π. ο. (ff lter
rulo is standing lere iu frunt of tte house) it really is to be regretted
that the learning and subtlety of so great a scholar as Hermann
should be abused for the purpose of disturbing a text so clear and
unexceptionable. He contende that οἶκος and olunt are not used ·
indifferently to signify a lousa, like ddunt and ddunt, δῶμα and
diluere, μέλαθρον and μέλαθρα, but that while aluos may be
used for the whole tonse, the plural implies the interior apartments
os tlte house. A person no sooner hears such a doctrine laid down,
than a multitude of passages crowd upon his recollection, in which
οἶκοι and olunt are used' ιιι precisely the same way,as asit suits the
metre οι· the fancy of the author. Even' ιιι this play instances
occur—as ιι. 708. οἴκους ἐρήμους delinearet, v. 898. ueneror κατ
οἴκους, v 999. ἑξῆλθονῖ ο κων. But ιιι regard to the first instance
and all others of the same class, it will be said that when οἶκοι un-
plies family or lune, the law of restriction does not apply, but the
plural may be used indiscriminately with the singular. And as to
