· IPHIGENIA IN AULIS. 219

——o—

Basrons the various detacbed lines, which, for reasons stated
in the Notas, are excluded from my text of the Iphigenia in Aulis,
there are two portioris of considerable length printed in a different
type at the end of the Tragedy. Upon these passages it is neces-
sary to say something for the satisfaction of the rcader ; but before
doing this, Iwill state the object of this publication, and the cir-
cumstances under which it is offered to the literary world.

Many years ago 1 was led by the perusal of a dissertation upon
tha Greek Tragcdians by Augustus Boeckb of Heidelberg, to
examine the text of the Iphigenia in Aulis with much care and
minuteness. In that book* it is ingeniously maintained, that the
drama which has descended to our times is not the productiori
of the great Tragedian, but that of a younger Euripides, his son,
or, as some say, his nephew. Of the proofs adduced to sup-
port this notion, the principal is a passage from the Scholiast on
the Raaoe of Aristophanes, v. 67. οίίτω ic* καί αί Διδασκαλίαι
φέρουσι τελευτήσαντος Εὗριπί3ον τ3ν vido αὑτοῦ 3ε3ι3αχίναι
ὁμωνύμως ἑν dorsi Ἰφιγένειαν τήν ἐν Αὑλί3ι, Ἀλκμαίωνα,
Βάκχας. But this implies only that ai'ter the death of the illus·
trious Tragedian, the younger Euripides exhibited three of his
posthumous pisces, of which this was one, in the name of his

father· a record, which coincides with the evidence of Suidas, who,
speaking 'of Euripidcs, says, νίκας 33 είλετο πέντε, raia μεν τέσ-

σαρας περίίιίιν, Τηνδ 36 μίαν μΕΤίί Τθλθντην, ἑπίδθίξαμένθυί ΤΟ

3ρᾶμα τοῦ α ’336λφι ον αὐτον Ενριπί3ον. Itis also contended
that a former tragedy did exist, written by Euripides himself, on
this subject: the following arc the argumentsz-lst. A passage of
the Ranae, v. 1309, in whichthe Shade of AEscbylus recites a cento
made up of expressions taken from chorio songs of Euripides:
chaudum, a‘i παρ αἐνοίοις θαλάσσης
κνμασι στωμυλλατε

τέγγουσαι νοτερῆς πτερῶν
ῥανίσι χροα 3ροσιζόμεναι.
