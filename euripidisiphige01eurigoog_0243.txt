but there' rs no mention found ιιι any Greek Geographer or other
writer, of a temple of Diana having existed at Aulis, nor is there
in this play any other allusion to such an edifica, except in a passage
acknowledged even by Hermann to be spurious. Euripides was
not accustomed to feign matters contrary both to the fact and to

the common belief among his countrymen 3 but supposing him to'

have chosen to representa temple of Diana as standing at Aulia
in the time of Agamemnon, isit conceivablethatno allusion would

have been made to it in all the previous parta of the play, even
in the Parodor, where the Chorus recounts what they had beheld

in their visit of curiosity to Aulis? indeed, they expressly name
the αλσος of Diana as the place were her sacrifices were per

formed (v. 181..) l feel therefore much confidence ιιι substimting

with the Poet's manner It was around the altar that the danae

Diana, the scene of the Tauria Iphigenia, he thought it would be
an improvement to introduce a temple in this Tragedy of Aulis.

scholare may prefer a differant arrangement, attaching αιμασιν to
the precedrng line, and θύμασί τι to v 1364. The latter will then
be of the same kind as 1391. βαλομὲναν χερνίβων τι παγᾶς, and
1408. κλέος ἀείμνηστον ἀμφιθεῖναι, 1..e atrochaic dim. brachya.
with a cretio prefixed, a frequent termination of a chorio period.

v. 1366. δάκρυά ’γε’ σοι edd. and MSS. δάκρυά σοι Blomf.
The γε has been inserted by some one who wished to make a
trimeter out of thia andthe last line. Itis worth while to rm
mark that this particle, so frequent and so expressive in the dia·
logue, is rarely adopted in the poetical parts of Tragedy ς so rarely
indeed, that whenever it is found in our copies, the passage should
