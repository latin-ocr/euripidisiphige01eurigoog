that this suggestion of putting Calchas to death rs treacherous and
inhumari: but this is in truth an argument for not altering the
words. Let us consider who the person is that utters them.
Not only throughout this play, but in other places, Euripides has
invested the character of Menelaus with every degree of pertidy,
cruelty, and meanness ; intending no doubt to represent the Spartan
king as a specimen of the odious qualities which the national preju-
dices of the Atheniens made them attribute to their enemies. And
this character is well maintained in the present scene: the actual
arrival of Iphigenia having convinced him that her sacrifice could
not any longer be avoided, he bethinks him of removing from his
brother's mind the impression produced by their recent altercation ς
and knowing his open and uusnspicious temper, he feels that he may
safely adopt a false position, and deprecate that of which he was
attha very time most earnestly desirous. 1 call the attention of the
reader to this fact, because Markland in his note has made some very
misplaced remarks on the alteration which takes place in the pur-
poses both of Agamemnon and Menelaus. I will only further ob-
serve, that the Poet has attended to the propriety and decorum of
character, in making Agamemnon abstain from any reply to the
proposal for the murder of Calchas
