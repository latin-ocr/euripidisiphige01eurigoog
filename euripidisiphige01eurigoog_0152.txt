lPHIGllNlA lN AULIS. 121

It would be a waste of words to point out the various and gross
faultsvof these verses, since I am not aware that they heve yet
found any body to defend their purity. To say the truth, they
eonsist in a great degree of words picked out of the few following
· lines ; but besides exhibiting 11 specimen of stupid and bungling
tautology, their numbers are not merely exposed to suspicion, but
ure grossly faulty, and unlike thoseof Euripides.

v. 544. Med. 923. Δρᾶσω rdd', οὔτοι σοῖς ἀπιστήσω λόγοις.
v. 545. Ὦ μῆτερ, ὑποδραμοῦσά α’ (ὀργισθῇς δέ μη) Πρδς
στέρνα παπρὸς στέρνα πᾶμᾶ προσβαλῶ] Commonly doro-
δραμοῦσά γ’, where γε is out of place, and the pronoun ie wanting.
Reiske is the author of the emendation. The common reading is
περιβαλῶ; interrogatively. But the adoption of προσβαλεῖν by
.the interpolator proves that προσβαλῶ was the word found in
the older copies of Euripides ; this likewise was observed by Porson.
If the sentenoe were interrogative, we ought to read not the future,
but the eorist subjunctive προσβάλως
ν. 547. Ἀλλ’, d τέκνον, χρη· φιλοπάτωρ d’ del ποτ’ εἶ
Μάλιστα παίδων, πῷὲ ὅσους ε’γώ Ἧκον] Τ11ε same hund
that has dealt so liberally with the rest of this dialogue, absurdly
gave these. two lines to Agamemnon ς Poroou restored them to
clytemnestra. χρη,1“4 is right, instead of the Aldine reading χρῶ,
is found in most if not ull the MSS. Next, all the copies hove
παίδων rdwd, a fault which it is surprising that 1 should be the
first to remove: in ploce of rbivd, a very slight correction gives
rdd, which is both an eaeier and more probable emendation than
thet of Elmsley, παίδων voli. Compare ν.1112. πό σῶμα τοὺ·

ndu, ὅπερ ἔτικτεν ἥδε σοι.

v. 551. So Med. 472. εὖ d ἐποίησας μολών.

v. 553. commonly ‘Os ον’ βλέπεις u’* εὔκηλοι, ἄσμενός μ’ idolo.
Matthiae erasos the first μ’, end gives the following note, ‘⁶ βλέπεις
μ’ εὔκηλοι Ald. rell. μ’ omittunt Parr. Α. Β. Flor. 1. 8. βλέπειν
εὔκηλον est placido vultuose, ut πεφροντικός βλέπειν Alc. 785.
dprud βλέπειν ap. Aristoph. Vid. Bergler. ad Arist. th. 565.
Plut. 328. Brunok. ad Arist. Av. 1169. Schaefer ad Lamb. Bos. p. 63.
placide aliquem adspicere esset εὐκήλως βλέπειν εἷς πινα.” See ¹
Monk on Alc. (789). Blomlleld (Gloss. AEsoh. Theb. 224.) would
have ue read ἔκηλονε but εὔκηλος is explained by Hesych. ἥσυχος,

πρᾶος. and so Hom. 011.Ξ.479. Εὗδον δ’ εὔκηλοι.
