186, Norae ΟΝ ΤΗΕ

sibly the matre, of the Aldine. But a great difficulty has been

made about the genitive πατρός following ἱκέτευσον, ιι verb
which generally governs an accusative. Markland would substitute
wdpm, Gaisford wolde, Blomfield τε πρός, Hermann τ’ ἐμοί.
The latter however retains warpds, observing that Euripides
might possibly have preferred xusing ἰκετεῦιυ in the same construe-
tion as verbs of similar signification, χρῄζω, δέομαι. 1 am always
happy to be able toagree with Hermann: and that norpds is eor-
rect, may 1 think be demonstrated from the two following passages
of the Medea 3 v. 938, Σθ θ’ α’λλυῖ orie κε’λευσυυ αἰτεῖσθαι πα-
τρός Γυναῖκα, παῖδας τήνδε ml φεύγειν χθόνα. v. 1151,
Δὲξει dd θῶρα, καὶ παραιτήσει πατρθς bayas ἀφεῖναι παισὶ
τοῖσ , dorio χάριν. In both these passages the ordinary con-
struction would have given πατέρα. Our vernacular languege -
admits similar lieenoes: while the common mode of speaking is,

entreat your-father, it would be quite allowable to say, entreot ‘ff
pour father, slat your maier παρ not be put to death.

v. 1138. One Paris MS. omits avi θανεῖν, substituting ὦς.
All copies bave αἴσθημά τι Κάν νηπίοις ’γε τῶν κακῶν ἐγγίγνε-
ται. Instead of τι, Hermann properly gives τοι, but l wonder
at his not observing that γε has no business in this sentence, and
that we ought to read κᾶν vaniores, which fully gives the sense,
even ιἰι ἱιρύιιέκ. τοι and ’γε are rarely found in the same sen-
tence: the former particle expresses as me all Ιιασιυ.

v. 1141. Ἀλλ’ allevat με, καὶ καταὶκτειραν βίον] βίον, for
filos, is the suggestion of Markland, which no subsequent editor
bas condescended to mention. κατ. βίον, amam misaam υἱέσι,

would hardly express the force of the appeal. με is governed by
worolsretpov as well as by uideam. Ihave already remarked
how much ludined our Poet is to the use of the gen. βίον (υπὸ.
οὔνεκα) at the end of a sentence.

v. 1142. This line used to end with ἀντόμεσθα driu φίλω,
not only presenting an saepest for tbe tsth foot, but violating
the Attio practice, which adopts llo and not Mo, as has been
elrowu by Dawes end other critice. Barnea properly gave θύα,
but his eredit was so small, that Markland and Maagrave would
mt even notius his correction. 'l'he former proposes θύω τέκνω,

deming the odrer frigidam el iaeffioam upon which Porsen oh-
serves “Nihili sunt, quoe ad hunc versum scripsit Vn doctus.
