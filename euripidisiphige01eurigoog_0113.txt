pretended weddiag, ia return for the anaidem i.e. ss the means of
procuring her to be sent to Aulis.
v. 106. Observe the Ellipsis of ε’γιδ in this verse.

v. 108. MS. Flor.'l. omits ovino, whence three other copies
give κατ’ εὐφρόνην, also without σκῖαν.

v. 111. Compare Ipb. T. 760. Τόνόντα κάγγεγραμμέν’ έν
δέλτον πτυχαῖς Λόγῳ φράσιν σοι πάντ’, α’ναγγεῖλαι φῖλοις.

v. 114. 115. These two verses used to follow v. 117, an error
first noticed by Reiskc.

v. 116. Πέμπω σοι πρός τός πρόσθεν ihdimus]- Hitherto

it has been written πρός ταῖς πρ. δέλτοις, the meaning of which
is, in addition to any former dispatches. 1 bave not hesitated to
introduce the accusative; the requisita sense being, ia relation to
my· former dispotches. The old man, speaking of this very inci-
dent in v. 793. says, Δέλτον ᾠχόμην φέρων σοι πρός τοὶ πρὶν·
γεγραμμένα.
. v. 118. The common reading is Μῆ στέλλειν τόν σόν ἶνιν Ι
πρός Tdv κολπιόδη πτέρυγ’ Εὖβοίας. 1 have erased the second
τόν which was inserted by a metrical corrector, who was desirous
of making two dimeters. It is to be observed that this system
consists, partly of Spondaic lines (which are dimeter catalectic),
and partly of anapaestic dimeters or monometers. The generality
of verses of the first description consist exclusively of long sylla-
bles: they seldom contain either dactyls or anapaests, except where
those feet follow one another, as in v. 122. παιδός δαίσομεν ὁμο.
ναίους, and in v. 1210. ὤφελεν έλόταν πομπαίαν, a licence which ·
the legitimate anapaestic system repudiates, or rather, only toleratas
in case of necessity. In this passage most editions place the prepo-
sition πρός at the end of a dimeter line, which is an improper
collocation, and though the article τᾶν is rightly joined with cdv
ἶνιν (i. e. the daughter of ahma Ι spolecio my former letter), yet it
is neither requisite nor appropriate in the second instance, for
there were other places to which the words κολπώδης πτέρνξ
might be applied as well as Aulis. This sea-port, although sepa-
rated from the Island by the narrow strait of Euripus, is styled
its voi .

Miikland indeed understood πτέρυγα as implying Chalcis in
Euboea, and wished to read in the next line vaihta. This seems
surprising, as he himself gives the very reason why the word
might be properly applied to Aulis3 he says “ Πτέρνξ est
