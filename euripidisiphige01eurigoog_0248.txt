murorum mnums. 217 Α

to denote the water contained in the sacrificial χέρνιβες, l do not
wish to create a difficulty. Still l arn bound to remark that εὔδροσοι
and πατρῷαι ‘seem strange epithets for the occasion, and that the
former is a word extant no where else. But if he apprehende
that something more was 'intended by the Poet, 1 avow myself of
the same opinion, and will give my reasons for suspecting that
he wrote οὐ δρόσοι παγαὶ πατρῷαι, or παγᾶν πατρῷαι, and by
this allusion to pert of the nuptial ceremonies of Greeoe, intimated
the maiden’s sad reverse of fortune, and the difference of the ap-
proaching solemnity from that which she had expected. At wed-
dinge a vessel was brought by the λουτροφόρος, filled with water
taken from some river or spring deemed sacred in the country
or the family, as Callirrhoe at Athens, and Ismenus at Thebes.
πηγαὶ πατρῷαι may signify παγαὶ πατρῴας γῆς. This custom
is directly spoken ofin Phoen. 357. ἀνυμέναια δ’ ’larmir ἐκηδεύθη
λουτροφόρον χλιδᾶς, where the scholiast says, Εῖῶθασι ’γαρ ol
νῦιιφιοι τδ παλαιὸν ἀπολούεσθαι ἐπὶ τοῖς ἐγχωρίοις ποταμοῖς,
καὶ περιῤῥαίνεσθαι, λαμβάνοντες ὕδωρ τῶν ποταμῶν καὶ πηγῶν,
συμβολικῶς παιδοποιΐαν εὐχόμενοι, ἐπεὶ ζαοποιὸν vd ὕδωρ καὶ
γόνιμον. The ancient Lexicographers recognize this custom. I
will further venture to express my belief, thet Lucretius had read
this passage of the Iphigenia in some such way, when he wrote
his description of the tragedy at Aulis, 1. 96. Nam sublata einim
manibus, tremebundaque, od αιας Deducta ectr αοιι ιιι, solemni more
ruovoram Perfecto, posset claro concitari hymenoeo; Sed casta inceste,

nubendi tempore ιἰι ipro, Hostia concideret mactatu moesta parentis,
Enitar ut classi felic faustusque daretur. Though ον’ δρόσοι for

εὔδροσοι is easy and probable, yet l confess that the other eorrec-
tion required, ἀλλά χέρνιβες, ἱε violent ; but if it be thought that
there is good ground for my suspicion, it may also seem likely
that some words have been lost from this sentence. ’

v. 1403. Ὦ πότνια, θύμασι βροτησίοις] Acretic trimeter.
Hermann repeats πότνια in order to make a senarian.

v. 1404. χαρεῖσα, gratified. The passive aorist ε’χοῖρην ἱε fre-
quentin Homer, and is adopted by Aristoph. Ran. 1028. Av. 1743.
Nuh. 274. nol τοῖς ἱεροῖσι χαρεῖσαι. Soph. Ant. 149. ἀντιχαρεῖσα.

After v. 1405. 1 have taken out of the text the line, real δ -
λόεντα Τροίας ἕδη, the words of which hetray their origin. The
Homeris adj. δολόεις, for δόλιος, is not adopted by the Attio, or,
