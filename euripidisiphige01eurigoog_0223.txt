Med. 8³7· ev'oidrr ῥοδὲιον πλόκον α’νθέων. Hel. 251. ῥοδὲα πέταλα.

ν. 1191. Ἔνθα ποτὲ Πολλὰς 1ἔμολεν, δολιόφρων τε Κύπρις,

Ἥρα θ’, ό Διός τ’ ἄγγελος Ἑρμᾶς]

ΑΙ] editions have nni δολιόφρων Κ. and Ἑρμᾶς ff ό Διός ό.
ln both cases Ι have adopted the corrections of Dr Monk, whereby
the first line becomes a cretio tetram. and the second an anapaestic
dim. Previously‚ they were not reconcileable to any description of
metre. lt may be remarked that the substitution of τε for rai,
in a sentence where the former copula is to be twice repeated, is

recommended by usage; and in the latter transposition, the collo- f

eation of Ἑρμᾶς is improved ,· it is the same as we lind in Electr.
462. Διός ἀγγέλῳ {riv Ἑρμᾷ.

ν. 1194. Κύπρις, d δὲ δουρὶ Παλλὰς] All the editions have
δορί. Elmsley proposes δορὶ δὲ Παλλός, omitting the article.
Monk gives δουρὶ, a much easier change, by which the line be·
comes, like the preceding, a Trochaic dimeter.

v. 1195. Commonly Ἦρα τοι Beck Ἥρα δότ Elmsley omits
the name of the Queen of the gods, and writes olle* Διός divona-ds
civatem βασιλίσι, and he is followed by Monk: but Ι think
it unlikely that Ἥρα would be omitted in this sentence after
the mention of her two rivals. I abstain from alteration, not con-
sidering it to be safe3 though l cannot help believing that there
bas been violence done to this line, as well as to several others, for
the sake of producing a lame senarian. The general flow of the ’
verses, as given by the Poet, was trochaie: consistency with what
precedes and follows might be maintained by writing,

ἁ δὲ Διός ἄνακτος εὐναῖ-
σιν βασιλίσι πότνι’Ἥρα.

ν. 1196. Κρῖσιν ἐπὶ στυγνόν ἔριν τε Καλλονᾶς, ἐμόν δι’
θάνατον] commonly τᾶς καλλονᾶς. Monk and Hermann omit
the article, and Matthioe observes “eds insititium videtur, non
solum ob metrum, sed etiam quod articulus abhorrete more Tra-

gicorum.” See v. 179. ἔριν ἔριν μορφᾶς. Androm. 278. ἔριδι
στνγερᾷ Κεκορνθμένον εὐμορφίας. I have given ἐμόν for ἐμοὶ,
as was proposed by Elmsley, from whose scheme however in all that
follows Ι must entirely dissent. After θόνατον the copies have
this bne, όνομα μδν φέροντα Δαναΐδαισιν, sinciput, which gave
offence to readers even in the time of Portus, as violating the lan·
guage by making μὲν and δὲ change places. Musgrave accord·
