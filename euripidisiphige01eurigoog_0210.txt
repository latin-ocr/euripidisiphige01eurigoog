lPHIGENlA IN AULIS. 179

it impairs the sound of the verse by too much sigmatism. Elms- ι
ley’s' rs still more objectionable, Θῦσαςδὲ εσην παῖδ’,εἶ εἶτα τίνας
εὐχὰς ἕρεῖς; for, as Hermann observes, prayers were uttered not
after but at the time of a sacrifice. Ι

ν. 1081. Τι’ σοι κατεύξει τάγαθὸν, σφάζων τέκνονς] This
is rendered Quid tibi honi ιἰι sacrificio filice precabare? and no editor
has ever made the least scruple about the language: it becomes
me therefore to' speak with diffidence; but Ι am not satisfieri with
the Greek of σι’ σοι κατεῦξει τάιγαθόνς the article being super·
fluous. Either τί σοι «arrigo ἅγαθόν; or τί το ἅγαθόν“’ ο σοι
· ιιατενξει; would be correct. If this remark be Just, ιι follows that
we ought to read ἦσοὶ κατεύξει τᾶγοθόν......; what? will you
prayfor yourself ιΙιοι which ir good, while sacrificing your child?

As to the following line, νόστον πονηρὰν οἴκοθέν ’γ’ αἰσχρῶς
ioiv3 every one, 1 think, will allow that it weakens the effect of what
goes before; so much so, indeed, as to excite strong suspicion that
ithus been intruded into the text; and this suspicion is augmented
by the embarrassment which it produces in the construction. Por-
tus rendere it, Num reditum malum, quum turpiter domo sir prry‘ectus?
I shall not criticise the translation, believing that the verse does
not belong to this passage: nevertheless it is not in the style
of those interpolations with which the reader is familiar. lt might
have been brought into this place from some lost Tragedy.

is I believe the reading of all editions, except Barnes’s and one
or two others which have οὔτ dp. Valckenaer (Diatr. p. ..108)

substituted ἦτ’ dp, Musgrave' ἦτ αρ’, which last 1 consider ιο
be right, if ιι be understood as ἦ τοι ἄρα. ΒοιΙι Matthiae and
Hermann prefer the common reading οὔτ dp, placing an inter-
rogation at the end of the next line My objection to this rs
that 1 do not believe ον τοι to be ever used interrogatively.1
have therefore adopted ἦ τ dp', the only reading which seems
ιο give a satisfactory meaning, Verily tien, ινι murt believe tlte
Godr ιο be senselers. Upon the nse of these particles in the be-
ginning of a senarius, see Elmsley on Heracl. 651. where he adds
his sanction of the reading which 1 have preferred.
