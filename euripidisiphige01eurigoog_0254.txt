IPHIGENIA IN AULlS. 223

unexceptionable than the manner, the allusione, and the language.
,But the two strophes and antistrophes with the epode appended
to this chorus have a widely different character: these, Ι am con-
vinced, are the productione not, as Hermann held, aliquanto recen-
tioris poetoe, but of some audacious interpolator, certainly not a poet,
probably not an Athenian, devoid alike of genius aud teste, who in
a copy, the transcripte of which have descended to us, attached
to the Paradae his own continuation. Itis nothing but au operose,
tedious‚ and inartificial enumeration of the Grecian Fleet‚ taken
without judgment or skill from Homer’s catalogue, destitute of
any resemblance to the poetry of the Tragedians, and composed in
verse the measures of which, though constructed with much regard
to antistrophic correspondence, are such as never came from the
peu of Euripides*

That the last scene of this Tragedy is a forgery, was first
pointed out by Porson iu his Supplement to the Preface to the
Hecuba, in the year 1802. That it should so long have been
tolerated as the productiori of the Poet, is a proof of the little
advance made before the present century ¹in metrical and gram--
matical exactness among the editors and readers of Euripides.

Besides these two long passages, many shorter interpolations,
dispersed over the play from the first page to the last, have
contributed to occasion indistinetness and disappointment, and
greatly to impair the pleasure of its perusal. 1f any person
acquainted with the Tragedy from other editions should huppen
to read it in this copy, I am pretty sure that he will acknowledge
the relies which the absence of those lines produces. lt is how-
ever not merely the dullness or uselessness oi the matter, but the
f reasons urged in the annotatione which have caused their rejection.
'The number discarded from the Dialogus as spurious is thirty-one,
of choric lines or half lines not quite so many. About two-thirds
oi the former and the whole of the latter are now, I believe, for
the first time impeached.
