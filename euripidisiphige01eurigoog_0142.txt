lonis initio, (Ἄτλας ὁ χαλκέοισι νώτοις eriperer) secl noa ιιιιιίοι
dicere nullos esae.” lt must be observed also that the Professor did
not alter, or find fault with, the line of the Hecuba in his own·
edition of that play, nor did he make any correction or complaint
respecting the other two passages, in his Adversaris.

v. 452. οἷς ξυναρπάσας στράτου] οἷς is the emendation of
Tyrwhitt for ὅς.

v. 455. άναρπάσουσι καὶ κατασκάψωσι γῆν] άναρπάσουσι
is Markland's'correction for ξυναρπάσουσι. He properly compares
Helen. 757. άλλά πόλις ἀνηρπάσθη μάτην. The common reading
ξυναρπάσουσι seems to have proceeded from v. 454: it has how-
ever found an advocate in Hermann, who wishes to understand
ημᾶς. Elmsley cites this passage as one instance among many of
the use of the dative of αὑτάς (αὐτοῖς τείχεσιν Κυκλωπίοις)
in speaking of the destruction of any body, or any thing3 buthe
proposes a different reading ξυναρπάσονται. The promiscuous
usage by the Tragedians of χῆ, χάριν and χθιάν, for πόλις, is
established by Valck. on Phoen. 5. ¹

v. 457. The words τά νῦυ τάδε conclude an lambio line in Heracl.
’ 641. Herc. F. 246. This is noticed by Elmsley on the Heraclidae.

ν. 460. πρὶν Aah, arciri ε’μὴυ προσθῶ λαβών] Hec. 368.
Athy προστιθεῖσ’ ε’μόν δέμας. Respecting the syntax see Elmsl.
on Med. 215.

ν. 461. Aster this line there is, in every copy of Euripides,
the following: ὑμεῖς τε σαγὴν, ὠ ξέναι, φυλάσσετε. It seems
to me surprising that not one of the numerous and acute critica
on the Play has made the least difficulty about this verse3 for
certainly there is none which in my judgment bears more clear
marks os spuriousness. Who ever found in the Greek language
σνγῆν φυλάσσειν for σνγᾷν, or σνγῇ καλύπτειν reiis? Nothing
can be more unseemly than that a speech ol' such importance should
have so lame and impotent a conclusion3 and i‘t is opposite to all
notions of propriety or probability that Agamemnon, who has
hitherto not once addressed or noticed the women composing the
chorus, or shewn himself conscious of their presence, should now, at
the moment of his quitting the scene, deliver to them, in these three
or four words, an injunction so deeply affecting his happiness. In
other scenes of our author, when secrecy on the partos the chorus
is intreated by an actor, every argument is employed to obtain their
sympathy. 'See Med. 262. Hipp. 707.
