IPHlGENIA IN AULIS. 157

v. 884. Some of the MSS. hare κακῶν ’γ’ ἐμῶν. The ex·
pressiori d'rooor κακῶν may be compared with ἄπεπλος φαρέων,
Pboen. 334. ἅχαλκος ἀσπίλου Soph. OEd. Tyr. 191.

v. 885. 6. Ἀλλ’ οὖν ἔχει τι σχῆμα, κᾶν ἄπωθεν ᾖ, Ἀνὴρ
ὁ χρηστὸς δυστυχοῦντας ὠφελεῖν] Both the Paris MSS. which
Ι collated have ἔχει τοι σχῆμα, and the same is found in other
MSS. But ehu τοι are not, l think, used in conjunction. If any
,change were desirable‚ I should prefer α’λλ’ οὖν ἔχει ’γε σχῆμα,
as ‘ys is very frequently used after ἀλλ’ οὖν, with the interposition
of a word. N eedless difficulties have been made about the explana-
tion of these lines. canter proposes to read ὠφελῶν. Portus and
Matthiae would join in construction χγρηστδς ὠφελεῖν. Hermann
unites κοῖυ ἄπωθεν ᾗ 'Avdp ὁ χρησπος, and translates etiamsi re-
motior rr't uir probus. The simple and obvious interpretationis the
true one: But ιἰι fact the good mun hus some grounds, even though he
he unconuected rulth them, for usdreiug the ury‘ortuuate. Hermann
suspects that the real reading might have been προσχῆμα. ⁸

v. 888. The promiscuous usage of the singular and plural
numbers, which pervadet the whole play, is here instanced in a
remarkable degree, the relative ἢ following. ἡμᾶς and πεπόν-
θαμεν. Ι have accented od, which requires its suli emphasis.

v.⁴889. εἶτα σοὶ τάχα Ὄρνις ’γένοιτ’ ἂν, σοῖς τε με’λ-
λουσιν γάμοις, Θανοῦσ’ ἐμὴ παῖς] All the copies haverolot
μέλλουσιν γάμοις. Ι have adopted the emendation of Markland

. σοῖς τε μέλλουσιν γάμοις, not only because it expresses the
obvious sense of the passage much better and withoutintricacy,
but because l have doubts whether the common readingwill bear
the meaning assigned to it. Admitting that the construction of
σοι τοῖσι μέλλουσιν ’γάμοις may be justified, yet l apprehend
‚that those words will not imply lo your future marriage, but that
the article would limit the reference to a particular and announced
wedding; as in v. 1241. Τήν ε’μῆν μέλλουσαν ενύἦυ μή κτανεῖν. .
The reading which Ι have adopted is agreeable to the common ὃ
usage of our Author. The sense is, perhaps the death of my
daughter will be omiuous to you uod your future ru'r'fe.
· v. 894: ἱκέτιν Portus for ἱκέτην, the reading of Aldus, which
should have been noted under the text, itis confirmed by some MSS.

v. 896. Ἥξει δι’ αἰδοῦς, ὄμμ’ ἓχονσ’ ἐλεύθερον] Person
altered the line thus, ἔξεισιν, αἰδοῦς ὄμμ’ ἔχουσ’ ἐλεύθερον.
