’ IPHIGENIA inaniis. 161

'ol the true words. Kal δὴ is commonly used in this sense ; Med.
387. Kal dvi τεθνᾶσι· τίς με δέξεται πόλιο; Hipp. 1011. Καί

, δὴ τό σῶφρον τοῦμδν οὐ πείθει σ’ ίσως. Ι have further changed

ἐπίθετ’ into ἔπιθεν, the sense being, For suppose thot your ea-
treatiee haue persuaded him. Different alterations have been pro-
posed, which seem much more violent; as πείσει’ Hermann, τὸ
χρηστόν πείσει’ Blomfield.

v. 921. Κοίγοί τ’ α’μείνων aspris φίλον γενήσομαι] Needless
changes heve been mede in this line: α’μείνων πρὸς φίλον, better
conducted towards ο friend, as Alceit. 445. oid ἀμείνον’ είς ἔμ’.

v. 922. rei πράγματα, publiea negotio, as in v. 287.

Alter v. 923. I have ejected a line, which, ‘while it mars the
construction of the sentence, exhibite as much as any thet can be
found, marks of the Interpoletor's bandy-work, Καλῶς di κρον-
θίντων, πρθε ἡδονήν φίλοις. It was inserted from a notion thet
the period ended, or ought to end, with σθίνει. The words
καλῶς κρανθέντων ure translated rebus benc persectis; but I do

not believe they could be so used; see note on v. 897. Nor even

if τῶν πραγμάτων or τῶνδε vvere expressed, am Isure thet
they would bear such a sense. Perhaps the render will feel
what those words really imply, if I quote two lines of our author,
Heracl. 605. Ὠς ‘cire τούτοις ἥδομαι πεπραγμένοις, Κρησμοῦ
τε μὴ κρανθέντος, οὐ βιοίσιμον. Moreover, 1 do not admit that
πρός ἡδονὴν φίλοις would have been used by a Tragedian to:
signify grata amicis. In regard to the versification, the line is

destitute of all hermony‚ nnd violates a rule which is observed,
by Euripides st least, with very few exceptione: it is divided into
two equal parts, without the quasi-cetura, and the second half
begins with a word not attached to the preceding, 'hut which
might commeuce a sentence. See this matter explained and illustrated

by Elmsley on Suppl. 303. (Clara θοντο.) The text of this play
contains but one instance of such ο formation (v. 227) and that line

is not so inharmonious as the present

v. 926. ’Ἤν d' αθ τι μή πράσσωμεν ὦν ε’γοί θέλω] The
editions bave ἢν δ’ αὐτὰ and ‘dv ἐγώ θέλω. As ἂν is plainly
out of place, Hermann gives cis ε’. θ. Ι have some conlidence
in my own emendation, αθ τι end ὧν ε’. θ. This construction,

though common, hasbeen often misapprehended by the transcribere
of manuscripts, and thus ‘oi‘ ν or clv has been substituted for riv. This
