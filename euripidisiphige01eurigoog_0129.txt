emendation which Ι have ventured to introduce, μηδέν’ οὖν Ὑέ-
vove ἕκατι, is very little removed from the reading of 'the MSS.
and has at least this merit; it expresses a sentiment which suits
the occasion, and was likely to be designed by Euripides. Aga·
memnon had been raised to his command in consequence of high
birth and large possessions3 aud in this as wellas other parts of
the speech, there is an evident reflection upon the practice of the
Atheniens, in selecting their generals and their ministers from the

distinction of birth and family.

Aldus has αν ω, but the princeps edition of Stobaeus has dvo.
In the following verse, Markland places a stop atter βλέφαρα,

v. 301. ἀνὴρ Ὑᾶρ χρηστὸς αἰδεῖσθαι φιλεῖ] We have
here an undoubted instance of the audacious manner in which the
textos this play has been treated, hy an ignorant corrector, through
whose hands that copy passed which has descended to modern
times. The reading of Aldus, and all the MSS. was ἀνὴρ ’γὰρ
αἰσχρός Ι000ιεῖσὸ οὗ φιλεῖ, with an insufferable elision of a
diphthong. Fortunately Stobaeus has been the means of recover-
ing the original: he cites it α’νῆρ ’γάρ χρηστός yppos-du aidri-
σθαι φιλοῖ, and Grotius accordingly published it correctly.
