IPHIGENIA lN AULIS. 85

proposed ἔζῃ for a(ou, in order, as I suppose, to avoid the
change of mood ιη μητε ἵζου, prise θελχθῇς Compare, how-
ever, v. 900 01 this Tragedy, ’μητε εξαΎε, μήτε ’ἔλθωμεν

v 141. Ευφημα θρόει] Α similar phrase, ευφημα φώνει,
occurs in Iph. T. 687 Herc. F. 1188. and ευφημος ἰ’σθι Orest.

1320. Hipp. 721. The same is the force 01 the Horatian words,
mole mesinatis Parcite uerbis

v. 143. Commonly uri τι σε λα’θη. Markland restored the
mette and sense by reading μή τις
Aster v. 146. the Edd. have the following line: Δ

ΠΡ. εσται. ΑΓ. κλῄθρων d' ἐξόρμα·

Two MSS. give ἔσται τάδε, which has been adopted by the
later editore. By this means indeed a dimeter is produced, but
such a dimeter as offenda against the anapaestic lawe, having au
hiatus at the end. And there are other things which still more
plainly shew this line to be an interpolation. Such an inter·
ruption 01 Agamemnon’s speech is both unnecessary and indecorous.
· And the imperative ἐξόρμα contributas to prove the forgery, it
being horrowed from v. 148. according to the custom 01 the inter·
polator of this Tragedy, who at the same time misunderstood its
usage, end gave it a passive instead of an active sense. Her·
mann has altered the position of this line, printing it alter v. 1493 .

but even if we read it in that place, the marks 01 spuriousness
will remain.

v. 147. 8. 9. The common reading' rs

ἦν ’γάρ νιν πομπαῖς ἀντήσας,
πόλιν &Eopuaost'r τους χαλινοός,
ἐπὶ Κυκλώπων rete θυμέλας
Itis easy to perceive in these lines that unlucky attempta

have been made at alteration. ⁸ ἀντήσας 11 a corruption for ἀντήσης, “
which rs souud' ια some of the MSS. But the construction 01

· the words νιν πομπαῖς α’ντήσης has occasioned great difficulty

to the interpretem. ἆνπᾷν governs either a genitive or a dative,

but not an accusative. The fact 1s that the metrical corrector,
being resolved to make the line a dimeter, took νιν out 01 v. 149

where it is required, and inserted it here, where it is needless
andQ He next introduced ‘roris in v 148, believing, 2
as it appears, that the middle syllable of χαλινοός could be made
short! πόλιν ἐξόρμα, orie χαλινοός 1s the admirable emendation ol
