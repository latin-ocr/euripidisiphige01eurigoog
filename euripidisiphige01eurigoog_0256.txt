the Purodus, that he confined his proscription to those spurious
stannus which my examination had detected‚ and that his sentimenta
respecting the author of this forgery coincided with my own3 al-
though the particular verses which he had denounced, as not belong-
ing to our Poet, are found in that part now admitted by him to be
genuine. But most of the other passages in the play which to my
mind bear marks of spuriousness, Hermann sanctiens, and many of
them he endeavours by alteration to reduce to correct language
and measure; an attempt in which he is not always successful.
The general character of his emendations is harah and violent, and
he has assumed a beauce of introducing them all into the text, as
well in cases where evident corruption called for reformation, as
in lines to which no reasonable suspicion could attach: so that the
play in his edition not only retains the former stumbhng-blocks,
but presente a multitude of new readings, the fruit of the
editor's genius, in which it is impossible for uther scholars to
acquiesce. The effect therefore of this publication, proceeding from ·
such high authority, is to obstruet rather theu promote the satis·
factory perusal of the Tragedy. Hermanu'a Iphigenia made me
believe theta reul service would be rendered tn literature by the
publication of a simple text, purified from intrusions, and deviating
from manuscript authority only where the language or verse shewed
that emendation was required. Accordingly, I committed to the

presslmy corrected copy, with no addition, except a collation of the
Aldine, and the excluded passages exhibited at the foot of each

page in a different type.

When the text was nearly printed, l was induced to deviate
nom my first intention by considering that, if it appeared with-
out any commentary, my design would probably be defeated3 since ’
the restorations require to be 'explained and justified. The want
of an editor’s name is perhaps rather favourable than otherwise
to the reception of solid and useful suggestions, since while they
heve nothing but their truth to recommend them, there is less oppo-
sition to be encountered from prejudice and fashiou. lt is however
not to be expected that readers should examina the claims of an
anonymons revision, about which the editor himself has said uo-
thing. Besides it is my opinion that many passages of the Iphigenia
in Aulis have hitherto been erroneously interpreted3 and that
correction is no less required in respect to wrong translations than
corrupt readings. To these consideratione my Notas owe their
