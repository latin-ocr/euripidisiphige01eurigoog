vaur ot' the nominative, and that the word is generally, if not always,
applied to persons. He properly reads ἀχήμασι for ἰαχήμασι.
The verse, which is commonly divided into two, is an antispastic
of the class noticed in v. 168.

v. 948. Aldus ἐν ύρεσι κλύουσαι. lhave adopted ἄν’ ipsas

from a Paris MS. Matthiae does the same, observing that this is
exquisitius.- one of the Paris MSS. which Ι collated has κλύουσαι,

the other κλείουσαι, which was first introduced by Brodaeus. l
have printed κλέουσαι, the emendation of Monk (on Alcest. 459.
ἐν τ’ ἀλύροις κλύοντες ύμνοις) Hermann adopts the same3 he
also gives (ipos, on account of nivei: but that preposition frequently!
governs a dative in poetry, as we may see in v. 659. and 959.

v. 955. Instead of λευκοφαῆ, another word λενκοφανῆ was
introduced, 1 believe by Portus, and held its place in some editions.

v. 956. Εἷλισσύιιεναι κύκλῳ] κύκλῳ is Heath’s emendation

for κύκλια. It suits the verse rather better than κύκλια, andseems ·

to be on other accounts more probable.

v, 957. Πεντήκοντα κόραι Νηρέως ’γάμους ἐχόρευσαν]
Νηρέως for Νηρῆος is the emendation of Seidler (De Vera. Daciam.
p. 261) He adopts however Heath's arrangement of the verses,

which is very erroneous. The strophe concludes with a Glyco-
nean and Pherecratean. Νηρῆος seems to have been put in by

a transcriber, who remembered the passage of Hesiod which our
Poct had in his eye, Theog. 263. Airai aiv Νηρῆος ἀμύμονος
ἐξεγένοντο Κούραι πεντήκοντα, ἀμύμονα 'e'p‘y' eiiciat· See lph.
Τ. 427. also Andr. 1268. “

v. 959. Ἀυοὶ δ’ ε’λοῖταισι, στεφανώδει τε χλόᾳ] The trans·
lationis Can abiegnis vero telis· et gramineis aaronis tarb'a venit
equestria Centaurorum. It may be doubted whether· Euripides in·
tended in this play to countenance the vulgar fable of the monstrous
nature of the Centaurs; he rather represents them as a tribe of
rude horsemen. In v. 828. he distinctly calls Chiron, one of their
number, ἀνὴρ εὐσεβέστατος. See his account of this race in
Herc. F. 364 Toiv τ’ ὀρεινόμον ἀγρίων Κενταύρων τοτὲ γε’νναν
= Ἔτριυσεν τόξοις φονίοις ...... Πεύκαισιυ ὅθεν χέρας Πληροῦυ-
τες χθόνα Θεσσαλῶν 'lanciam ἐδάμαζον. In that play, however,
the epithet rerpaoaehris is twice applied to them v. 181, 1272.
