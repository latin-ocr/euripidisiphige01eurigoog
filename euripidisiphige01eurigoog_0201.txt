σιουῑ Markland intimated that εἰ( should be erased, aud in fact
one Paris MS. does omit it χεροῖν is from Musgrave. This pre·

1ε rs omitted rn three MSS. Canter proposed πάρος for πατρός,

ἠ1έιυιμ ορᾷς, which I wish that my text had adopted. Ihave
no example to justify the use of ἡ1έιυς ορᾷς for ἡ 1έωο βλέπεις,
and when we consider that the latter would have suited the verse

defends it, rendering οῦχ vidior ὁρᾷς, non suaviter prorpicir.
