156 noras on rna

approves this restoration3 Hermann adopts αἵματος, but retains
(privor. aluerat, shall witness. So Phoen. 1691. ’Ὶστω σίδηρος
ὅρκιόν τ’ ἐμοὶ ξίφος. 260. dv Ἄρης τάχ’ εἵσεται.

ν. 875. dede ἐγώ πὲφῃνοί σοι Μέγιστος, οὑκ dv· ἀλλ’
ὅμως γενήσομαι] Markland styles these words stultissima. But
we must regard them as an instance of that simplicity of sentiment
and language, which seems sometimes to be affected by Euripides.
The following is Hermann's observation, “ Vellem ego quidem
aliam hic legeremus perorationi aptam sententiam: sed tamen,
quum omissis his versibus deesse justus finis orationi videatur,
recte, ut arbitror, Matthiae in his quoque Euripidis argutias cap·
tandi studium agnoscit. Volebat poeta, nisi fallor, magnitudinem
periculi indicare, si Agamemno, si universus exercitus, et diis qui-
dem secundum Calchantis vaticinia auctoribus, sacrificium virginis
expeterent. Non dissimilis peroratio est ν. 908. 909.”

ν. 879. φεῦ, an expression of admiration, is estro versum here
asin 619.

v. 880. Μήτ’ ἐνδεῶς, μήτ’ ἀπολέσαιμι τὴν χάριη] ΑΗ
the MSS. have μήτ’ ἐνδεῶς, μὴ τοῦδ’ ἀπολέσαιμι τήν >pipam
from which Markland gives ε’νδεῆς τοῖνδ’, Hermann ἐνδεῶς τοῦδ’.
Itis not possible to speak with confidence in this matter: but
as the reading of Aldus aird the old editions seems liable to no
objection in point of sense, I have deemed it the safer way to
adhere to it; more particularly as the word aoid in the MSS.
from which the emendations are drawn, is not unlikely to have
been inserted as an explanation.

v. 881. 2. Αἰνοιίμενοι ydp d’yaOoi τρόπον τινοί Μισοῖισι
τούς αἰνοῦντας, ἦν αἰνῶσ’ ἄγαν] Commonly οἰ ’γαθοί and ἦν.
Stobaeus Tit x11. cites these lines, and the edition of Trincavellus
'has dycdol and ὁίν. Porson wrote α’γαθοί, according to the
well known rule, that the erasis of the article with α always pro-
duces a long ᾶ. Barnes cites the same sentiment from Orest
1159. παύσομαι δ’ αἰνῶν σ’, -ἐπεὶ Βάρος τι κᾶν reid ἐστὶν,
αἰνεῖσθαι λίαν. We may add Heracl. 203. sal γὰρ onir ε’πί-
φθονον Λίαν ἐπαινεῖν ἐστι. πολλάκις le* dri Καιίτός βαρυνθεὶς
old, dycta αἰνούμενος.

ν. 888. Αἰσχύνομαι δὲ παραφέρουσ’ οἰκτροιίς λόγους] The
common word would have been προσφέρονσ’, as in ν. 96, πάντα
προσφέρων λόγωι amney (on soph. OEa. cn. 1675) observes
that παραφέρονσα is.here used sor προσφέρουσα.
