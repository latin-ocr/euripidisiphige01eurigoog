v. 276. The common reading' ιε Χιλὶοιν” ορχων, Πριάμου τε
rre'drou ἐμπλήσας δορός, the third foot being a dactyl, ιιι oppo-
sition to the trochaic law. Resides, they who Join ἄρχων, ἐμ·
πλήσας πε, will' m vain endeavour to give any satisfactory sense
to this line. The first who read ad Πριάμου ars'drov was Dr
Elmsley (Edinb Rev. xix. p. 71) with this translation, because you
ruere not able to land your army at Troy, though ρον laad a thou
rand ships ander your Qcommand He' rs followed by Hermann

v. 277. Κᾶμε παρεκάλεις, Ti δρόσος alva δὲ’ πορον ενρω
πόθεν· ,] Matthia pronounces this yerse to be a violation of the
metre, and accordingly prints τίνα wdpovd'. From this and other
remarks it ιε clear that this editor does not correetly understand
the lawa of tetrameter trochaica: he approves the preceding line
in its old corrupt state, and condemns the measure of the reseut, “
which ιε faultless. Let it be granted that πίνοι πόρον d supro
πόθενς would be paullo numerosius: still we may remark that

insuch casea of a double question, ds¹ usually follows the' interro-
gative, without the intervention of any-other words, as in v. 4³3.
πῶςς τις d αναγκᾶσει σε τήν ’γε σην anausim Respecting
the construction we will give one hint. Menelaus intended to
say κάμὲ παρεκάλεις ευρεῖν πόρον τινα, ὥστε μή σε, στερενποι
ἀρχῆς, ἆπολεσαι καλὸν κλέος, but' ιιι order to fix the charge
more strongly upon his brother, he repeats the actual words which
Agamemnon had spoken on the occasion.

v. 278. The editions before Markland have ἀρχᾶς. The fol-
lowing arethe words of Professor Dobree (Advers. ιι. p. 83)“ dors
nri στερέντας Musgr. sed male explicat, ut nos pro ego dicat
'Agamemnon Intelligo ne ego et tu, Menelae, amittamus? I cannot
acknowledge the justice of this criticism, being convinced that the
words refer to Agamemnon alone. Menelaus was not so much bent
upon the pursuit 'of glory, as of revenge‚ and the recovery of his

consort.

v. 284. Κᾷθ νποσπρέψας λελῆψαι μεταβαλών ἅλλοις
γραφάς] Aldus and most other editors give λελησαι, which Ι
they render clam, insciis nobis: but that ιε the real version not of

λε’λησαι, but of λέληθας. All the MSS. have λελῆψαι, which
has been properly restored to the text by Musgrave. it means
deprehensus es.

v 285. Ως Moysis* ονκετι θυγατρός ons coer μάλιστά γε]
Instead of μάλιστά ὙεΙι. Dindorf edits adhibenti ys. Hermann
