ln the following lines 1 have taken the liberty of omitting several
words, which appear to have arisen partly from interpretatione written
in the margin, and partly from a desire to produce a system of
dimeters. At the foot of the text are found the six lines as they
stand in the copies of our poet, out of which I have made three 3
comprising all the meaning that can be extraeted out of the sir,
without any of their improprieties. Before the reader condemns
such a liberty taken by an editor, 1 requeet that he will carefully
peruse thesis verses, and if he be not himself satisfied that they
include some interpolatione, he may retain and cherish them, entire
and unaltered. If however he be convineed that some intrusione
have been forced on the text, let him accompany me in a candid
· and detailed consideration of the passage. πομπὰν was suggested
by πομπαίαν, ιιι its immediate neighbourhood3 and Euripides
would not have said πνεῖν πομπαίν, but πνεῖν αι’ίραν. Then μει-
λίσσων seems quite inappropriate in this place, and arose from the
mistake of the interpolator, who fancied that a calm was implied,
whereas Iphigenia speaks only of the prevalence of adverse winds;
besides, the syntax in this place would have required μειλίξας.

’ the interpolator took the word from another line of Euripides,

Hel 1855. Ζειίς μειλίσσων στυγίους opyas. The sole meaning
of what follows rs, that the breeae, sent hy Jupiter, brought hap·
pineas to some mortale, and adversity to others, the marginal ex·
planations intimate that some could put to sea, while others were
wind· bound; to the former being applied the words ἐξαρμᾷν and
στέλλειν, (they should rather have been ἑξορμᾶσθαι and στέλ-
λεσθαι), ιο the latter μέλλειν Again, ποῖσιδέ λνπαν ιε, lthink,

a palpable gloss of τοισι d ανοίγκαν. Αε for λαίφεσι, 1 consider
it to be an interpretation written by an ersing scholiast over ταῖς
