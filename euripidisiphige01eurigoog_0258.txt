it necessary to declare my dissent from the positione of Gonrrtrrr
Hnnmww malsc me fearful that l may appear unfavourably dis-
posed towards that distinguished critic. Against such an opinion,
I must earnestly protest. Hermann deservedly ranks as the first of
living scholars ; aposition which he has fairly earned by his learn-
ing and genius, as well as by the unwearied industry with which he
has devoted himself for half a century to classical publications3

neque ego illi detrahere ausim

Haerentem cupiti multa cum luade coronam.
Possibly his edition of the Iphigenia in Aulis may have been a
hasty performance3 possibly age may have· somewhat changed his
acutencss into subtilty; possibly his undisputed supremacy in this

species of literature, and the homage paid by his countrymen to
his critical decrees‚ may have given him too great confidence‚ and
encouraged him to indulge his genius for alterations with unre-
strained licence. Whetber one, or all of these causes may be in
fault, 1 will not pronounce: but it seems to metuo plain that he
has injured, more than he has amended, the text of this Tragedy.
Whenever 1 consider him to be right, 1 have not been slow to
declare approbati0n; in the few cases where he has anticipated my
own emendations, l'have given him the undivided credit of them;
and where Ι condemn him, it is only upon matters of judgment, in
which no man is too eminent to have his opinions called in question.

Alter what 1 have said of my own edition, it is superfluous
to offer apologias for its errors and imperfections3 it is evident
that a long abstraction from critical studies, and the absence of
all assistance from others, must cause a much larger proportion
of oversights than would otherwise have existed If the object pro·
posed by this publication shall have been successfully attained, its
errors and defecta will probably be forgiven: if it fail, the worst
fate which awaits it is a peaceful oblivion.
