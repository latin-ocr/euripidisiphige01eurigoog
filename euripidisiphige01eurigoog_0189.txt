158 Novus ΟΝ THE

This was a juvenile correction, which deserves the praise of in·
genuity, but will not bear examination. αἰδοῦς ἐλεύθερον does not

· properly express free from alume, and it would have been no com-

pliment to the maiden, that she was ready to come into the presence
of Achilles with an unblushlng cheek. But the use ol' dua and a
genitive, particularly aster verbs of motion, is ao common in the
Tragedians, and is in fact a form of which they are so remarkably
fond, that every scholar will remember a number of instances to
confirm the common reading3 it implica, Aderit cum omecvadio
vultum habeas ingenuum. Brunck (on Bacch. 441. Kdyd δι’
αἰδοῦς εἷπον) explains this form thus, “ Nomina cum praepo·
sitione ‹lal constructa, cognatorum adverbiorum vicem plurima
sustinent, et in ea resolvi debent” Elmsley there cites Bacch.
212. l'levdede πρὸς οἴκους lide ded σπουδῆς περᾷ. Soph. OEd
T. 807. Παῖω ds’ ὀργῆς. Neverdreless he approves Porson's con-
jecture, but 1 think without due consideration. Hermann adopts a
construction horrowed from Barnea, placing a comma after ἥξει.

’ v. 897. Ἥ μη παρούσης, ταύτὰ τεύξομαι σε’θενς] ταῦτα
Aldus, ταὺτοῖ eadem Markl„ The note of interrogation is from
Heath. Elmsley (Heracl. 44.) proposes an entire reformation of
this passage, and gives the next line, not to Achilles but, to Cly-
taemnestra, reading, Ei l ἡ παροῦσα ταῦτα’ τεύξομαι σέθεν,
Μενὲτω κατ’ οἴκους. σεμνὰ γὰρ σεμνύνεται. Ὁμοῦ &daos
γε devonia, αἰδεῖσθαι χρεών. Icould propose an emendation
more to my mind; but I leave this line untonched, except as
above stated, because 1 have suspicions, and no trlfling ones, of
its integrity. In the first place it is absolutely useless, and con-
tributes nothing to the appeal of the Queen; vvhile the reply of
Achllles, μενέτω κατ’ οἴκους, would come with more propriety
alter the preceding line. Therefore, even if this verse were pure
and faultless, still the dlalogue would bea gainer by its absence.
But the language is aot free from exception. l doubt whether
Euripides would have used μη παρούσης independent ol* the
genitive with which it agrees. ln cases of a genitive absolute,1
think that the noun or pronoun should be expressed, since it must
almost always be emphatic; the sentence therefore requires
selvas usi παρούσης. Nevertheless the Greek of this verse is
so much better than those which 1 have ejected, that 1 cannot
attribute it to the same interpolator whose heavy hand has· in-
ilicted so much dreary dullness upon this beautiful Tragedy. l
