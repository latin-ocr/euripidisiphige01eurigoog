μάλιστ-α’ ‘y' civ, which he renders cam maeimesaeris. Leaving the
reader to form his own opinion of these substitutions, 1 shall only
observe that the common text seems to me unimpeachablc.

v. 286. Οὗτος αιίπός ἐστιν αίθῆρ, ds πέδ ἤκουσεν σέθεν]
Markland wishes to read οὗτος diets, aud this has been adopted
by Matthiae and Hermann; but there is nothing objectional in
the ordinary reading: it implieS, thia ia the very air, which heard
sach your declaration. So v. 1961. τοῦτο δ’ αὑτῶ βούλομαι
Etruscis πρᾶξαι. I think however that there has been a dis-
turbauce in the order of the verses and that this line ought to
precede 284.

v. 288. Ἐκπονοῦσ’ έχουτες] Instead of ἔχοντες, Canter,
Scaliger, and recently Hermann, give ἑκόντες, which sounds very
weak and flat; while nothing can be more correct than ἔχοντες,
scil. πεί πράγματα, ahila ia affice, ιἰι tte administrativa of affairs.

v. 289—90. Vulgo γνώμας. This Dorism was condemned by
Markland. Hermann joins ἐνδίκως α’δέναποι γεγῶτες, and ren-
ders it uere impotentes: to which construction I cannot assent.

tv.91. Ελλᾶδος μάλιστ”’ εγωγε τῆς ταλαιπώρου στένω]
“Hunc versum respicit Eubulus Comicus ap. Atheuaeum xm. 3.
p. 569. A. Ελλοίδος” ε’γωηε τῆς ταλαιπώρου πέρι Στένω.”

Markland. “In Eubuli versu miror Marklandum non vidisse ex-
pungendum, tum Euripidis auctoritate, tum metri jussu, importu-
num istud πέρι.” Ρονιοιι. This suppression of the preposition

Τῶν πάντων ου τόσσον ὁδυρομαι, αχνυμενός περ, Ως svor.

v. 292. τοιίς οὐδένας, acii. ποδς οὐδέν ὄντας. This plural is
found also in Andr. 701. ὄντες οὐδένες. Compare Soph.Aj. 1114
ori ’γὰρ ἠξίου τούς μηδένας.

υ.294. The reading of the copies is Μηδέν* av χρέους ἕκατι
προστάτην θείμην χθόνος, Mai* ὅπλων’ αρχοντα. That there
is some corruption in these lines nobody will dispute; for μηδέν
’ dv θείμην ra a solecism, the Greek language requiring ουδέυ
αν θείμην. This Hermann remarks, but his mode oi' correcting
the passage Ι cannot regard as i'elicitous. He introduces into his
text ου χρέους έκατι, and translates it, sui commodi gratia. In
the first place δς, suas, is very seldom used by our Poet; and
secondly‚ Iremember no instance of the genitive χρέους The
