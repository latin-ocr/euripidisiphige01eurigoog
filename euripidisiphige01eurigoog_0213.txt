182 NO'l'llS ΟΝ ΤΗΕ

v. 1102 The common reading rs ει ’3 ευ λέλεκται vrci, μη
dri ’γε κτάνῃς, in which νῶϊ is a glaring corruption: but it is
not possible to correct the line with much confidence, since it
cannot be said that any word 111 the place of νῶϊ is absolutely

necessary either to the sense or the construction. Elmsley's con-
jecture τάμὰ is by much the best and most probable that has

1ωηρ1οροεεάρμῆσῦ Ὑε,1111111(101μ113ηή,γε is my own emend·

ation: it seems preferable to Elmsley's μη311 ori, or Blomfield's
galaistans σιί ’γε adds materislly to the force of the queen's ad·
juration at the conclusion of her speech, do aot you ot least—.
as Med. 1052. μη σνγ ε’ργοίση τάδε.

v. 1105. Aldus and the MSS. have Ἀγάμεμνον· ον’3είς πρὸς
1113 αντείποι βροτῶν, in which the absence of clv distresses every
reader solicitous for the purity of a Greek sentence. Markland
observes, Demosthenes inseruisset dv, tn which Elmsley adds, neque
omisisset Euripides. The latter thinks that instead of ἀντείποι
the Post wrote (irrepsit the same conjecture is also propounded
by Blomfield and by Hermann. Having such formidsble authority
against me, it is with due humility that the following suggestions

are made-It does not seem very probable that any person would
write ἀντείποι (or ἀντείπῃ, as one MS has it) as an explanation
ο1 ἀντερεῖς the verbs ἀντειπεῖν and ἀντερεῖν should rather be'
joined with a dative, than with πρός and an accusative, as in the
¹ first instance quoted by Elmsley in favour of his emendation,
Hipp. 401. οιί3είι· ἀντερεῖ βουλεύμασι. and badan instance oc-
curred of the other syntax, it would probably have been cited by ,
one of those critics. The reading which 1 have given, οὐδείς
τοῖσ3 dv ἀντείποι βροτῶν, is unimpeachable on the score of
syntax or ο1 sense, and1s agreeable to Tragic language. If we
suppose it to have been written by the Poet, nothing' ss more
likely than that ο1ν might have been left out in a MS. on account
of the same letters following 111 the next word; 1n which case, it is

exceedingly probable that 111 order to set straight the halting metre
arpos τά3 was substituted for τοῖσ3.

v.1106. Ei μεν ‘cdv Ορφὲως εἶχον, ὠ ποίτερ, λογον,
Πείθειν ἑπᾳ3ονσ diod ομαρπεῖν μοι πέτρας] The meaning is
the same as if Iphigenia had said, ei μεν εἶχον, ιὶίσπερ  Optpsris,
πείθοι’ ᾳσιιασι πέτρας dic. The editors compare a similar pas-s
sage in the Alcestis of our Authorv 367. Eid Ορφέιοι μοι
