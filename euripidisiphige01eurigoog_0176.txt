IPHIGENIA IN AULIS. 145

, sc particularly to the two individuale, an answer would hardly be
Ι satisfactory without the use of the dual; and by ιιι adoption we are

-relieved from the ὁμοιοτέλεντον ιιι μόνοις λέγοις. Both Matthiae
and Hermann substitute ιιι the text βασιλικῶν sorticularios,
without authority, and without alleging any reason for the change.
If such liberties are to be taken to procura a short syllable instead
of a long one in this part of theverse, a multitude of other lines
must sustain similar violence. 'lu Med. 956 the same adjective
appears in the corresponding place of a Senarius‚ Δοκεῖν σπανίζειν

«ldae βασίλειον atatam and these Trochaics are subject to

, similar laws, consisting of a Cretic (resolved or unresolved) prefixed

to a Senarius. Matthiae properly observes that this verse belongs
ιο Achilles, not Clytaemnestra, to whom itis commonly assigned.

corruption. Many have been the Μαιιειιιιιιε ιο restore the true
reading. Scaliger conjectured εἰς μέλλοντ’* αν ein Reiske εἷς

Matthiae adopts), Musgrave ἀνοιστέος, Boeckh ὀνήσει, Her-

Boeckh’s rs the only one which has any semblance of probability.
l have ventured to give a place ιιι the text to my own emendation,
o λ6Ὑοε εις μέλλοντα σαίσει χρόνον, which, it will be observed,
differs from the old reading by only one letter, and might easily
be changed by a person who did not understand a rather uncommon
construction. Achillss3' m ridicule of the old mans self important
speech, πρόνοιάθ η μη σῶσον orie ἐγω θέλω, and of hia delay
in declaring his meaning, says, Your speech will postpone their pre·
acroation to α distant time, 1. e. ott he α long time befirre it preserves

next pronounces dyrov τινιί ιο be prorsas ineptum, and substitutos
ὄκνον τινιί, aliquid timoris. To me this sounds very flat, while Ι

can discover nothing absurd or inappropriate in the common reading,
the sense being, but it contains ιιο little small, or arrogance. hyrcos
