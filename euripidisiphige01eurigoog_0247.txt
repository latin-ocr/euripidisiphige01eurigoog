v. 1392. The edd. and MSS. have Βωμόν γε δαίμονος θεᾶς

‘Primam αἱματορρύτοις Θανοῦσανι beyond question such were
not the words of Euripides. Portus, mistaking θανοῦσαν for θανου-
μένην, manslates it, ad arans numinis dea morituram. Of con·
jectures l shall mention only Markland'a, βωμόν διαὶμονος Oete
and ῥανοῦσαν, both which are embraced by Hermann with much
applause. 1 trust that my emendation, χρανοῦσαν, will be schow-
ledged as more like the Tragedian's language: compare v. 873. Aa
for διαίμονος, the word can no where be found: the adjective in use
is diurnos. It is true that both ὅμαιμος and ὁμαίμων are used,
but it is not safe to reason from one compound to another. Even
did laetans exist, Ι hardly think that the Poet would style
Diana, though in this instance θύμασι βροτησίοις χαρεῖσα
by the title of α ὂὶοοᾰρ goddess. At any rate we ought not to
insert from guess another compound of αῐμα ιιι the same sen-
tence with αἱματορῥντοιι. It appears to me pretty certain that

θοᾶς was written in one MS. as an explanation of δαίμονος, and,
as osten happened, was adopted rnto the text of another. There re-
mains the particle γε, which is quite indefensible 3 but what should
be substituted for it, is not equally clear: 1 have given ἔτι as the
most probable that has suggested itself. Thermae ia cretic. 1
venture to think that an argument in favour 'of my reading may be
drawn from the words of Lucretius 1. 85. Aulide qao pacto Triviai

poet had read ιιι Euripides χρανοῦσανΡ

joiu σφαγεισαν with the preceding participle, and understapd

σφαγεῖσαν rs und τῆς σφαγῆς, as Reiske explains it. The other
words imply only εὐφυοῦς σώματος dapar. Markland compares
