ip the active discharge of patriotic dutiea Markland's conjectura,
ἑνῶν for όνόον, meets with the approbatiou and applause of Matthiae
and Hermaunst ιιι which 1 am quite unable to joiu. And μυριο-
ιιληθῆς rs an epithet suiting πόλις, but not aciones, to which all
the editions join it. The proposal of εργον Ιοι sudor, given in
the margin of the text, is a mere guess3 but' rt has, Ithink, some
recommendation3 it involves only a small change of letters, and

such aa was likely to arise from quiek and indistinot writing3 and
it would afford a plain and appropriate meaning. ἔργον, in re·

word action. μειζω πόλιν αὔξειν rs, to' ιιιοιιοιε ιο ο still greater

Hermann fancies that he bas enred the disorder of the tert by
writing ιο Πάρι, μητι ori γι. Beiug unable either toapprove or
to comprehend his criticism, 1 will gire the reader bis own words:
“,Nemo opinor, semel monitus dubitabit quin hoc dici debuerit,
