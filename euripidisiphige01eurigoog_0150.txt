nor is it 'quite seendy that a young lady οιι ιλε eve of marriage
should be listed in the hands of other damsels, like an infant. But

if we proceed to examine the words, the forgcry will be easily
detected. rsarldmorv ἀγκάλαις is an expression which it is
hopeless to defends· but two Paris MSS. have ascvilarem, which
Musgrave admits into the text, defending it by νεάνιδος ἥβης dac.
A better reading was proposed by Pierson, Veririm. 1. 6. ὑμεῖς dd,
νεάνιδές, νιν ἀγκάλαις ἔπι. This is adopted by Hermann; but
I know no example of ιλε two first syllables in νεᾶνιι being con-
tracted into one, nor can Ι believe that Euripides would have
written such a verae as this, when he might as easily have given
one of unexceptionable rhythm, vasis d επ ἀγκάλαις νιν, ιο
νεάνιδες hastly, it may be observed that the second of the two
verses is almost entirely made up of words picked out os neigh-

bouring lines (viz. 608. 629.) according to a practice of the Inter· .

palatos· which hasbeen so often noticed.

v. 534. ἐκλείπω Musgrave, from one MS.
ι. 535. All editions have Aid eis πο πρόσθεν &o Dobree
(Adsere.) properly substitutea oi d clytemnestra rs ordering her

grooms, and not the ladies of Chalcis, ιο stand at the horses'
heada, while she slights.

.5ν.40. εγειρε is used for ἐγείρου, ιλε pronoun being under-
stood. This· ιε noticed by Porson on Orest. 288. where άνακάλνπτε
is for dvuaahrirr‘rov. He compares καταπαύσας Ηεα. 918. επει ys
Orest 789.

ν. 542. The old Editions have Λῆψει, το ’Νηρῇδος παιδάε
ἱσάθεον’ γενος Milton corrected it to Ν ηρεινι παιλός, and’ ιε
followed by Markland and Musgrave. But ιιι four MSS. the word
παιλόε does not appear. Therefore the reading αι’ Portus⁸ rs pre-
ferable, τά τῆς Νηρῇδος i. γ. and so l hare edited the line,
along with Matthiae and Hermann. Boeckh takes an exception
against this passage, and thinks that he has caught the Poet napping.
clytemnestra, as he fancies, appears from her subsequent enquirier,
not to know who was the mother of her promised son· in· law.
But the mistake⁸ rs his own. From v. 100. Τα τ ἀξίωμα πάιάράς
ε’κγανρονμενος, it appears that Agamemnon had taken care to dilate
on the consequence αι’ this young hero, and was therefore not likely
to omit the circumstance of his being Goddessborn. And il⁸ we
compare vv. 610. 617. we shall perceive that Clytaemnestra had
