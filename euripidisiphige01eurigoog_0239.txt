208 noras ou suu

commonly ἐγώ μαι-α’ ’γε σοῦ. Markland suspected that the posi·
tion of ys should be altered: ἔγωγε is iu fact necessary for the
harmony of the verse. See note v. 1060. The render may com-
pare the concluding part of this scene with the parting of Hecuba
from her daughter Polyxena in Hec. v. 402 to 440.

v. 1343. aui πάλιν ’γ’ οὗ μὴ μόλω] Yes, ond 1 stall nol
come book again. Another instance of ori μη with the aor. subj.
used as a negative future, is in v. 1380. ‘heht ’γὰρ οὔ ⁰⁶ μῆ
λίπῃ. Elmsley has collected many instances of thia syntax in his
note ou Soph. OEd. Τ. 870. but has omitted these two. lpresume
that there is now no need of cautioning even titos against con·
founding this construction with that osori pai joined to a future
indicative, as Dawes haedoue in Miro. Cn't. p. 221.

v.1344. Λιποῖισα μητέρ’; ΙΦ. uit· ὁρᾷς ιγ’, otis ἇξῖωι]
lphigenia's words imply, Yes, as you ναις not in o fitting monum,
ie. ootfor my weddirg, bot sor my slouglrter 1 should not have
explained a sentence of such obvious meaning, had uot Bremius
and Hermann quarrelled with the words ουκ α’ξίωι, as being uu·
mitable to the speaker Hermann substitutos ιιι his text ev κᾶξὶνη,
which' rs surely an unfortunate change. He has taken those words
from a passage of our author, Hec. 976. as dissimilar from the
presentes can be imagined Hecuba on receiving Polymestor's
essurance that her son Polydorus was alive and well, and knowing
at the same time that she was speaking to his murderer, replies
with the bitterest' irony, Ω paueat? αι εν ’κᾶξὶινς σέθεν λέγεις.

v. 1347. Toup (Curae Ponerst sn Theocr. p 29) citing this
passage, says, “Per Auis κόρην Ἄρτεμιν intelligendus hymnus,
sive paeon in Dianam, qui ab istis verbis inchoabat. Huc respexit
poeta infra v. 1521 (1400)”. Matthiae says, ‘Mihi ἑπευφημιίσατε
παιᾶνα dictum esse videtur pro παιανίζετε, hinc Ἄρτεμιν addi-

tum.” There seems to me uo necessity for having recourse to any ³

such explanatione. The two accusatives παιᾶνα and '',Ap·reusv each
of which might separately follow ἑπενφηαήσατε, are here both
governed by thesaure verb. Compare lph. Τ. 1403. Noivurd'
ἐπευφήμησαν ενχαῖσιν κόρης Παιᾶνα.

v. 1348 lvo de Δαναΐδαις ινφημὶα] Portus rendere this,
Veniet tantem bonum omen Grecis. Markland prints Δαναΐδαις

ὲῦφημῖα ιιι capitale, as being the actual words of the Paean. Mus- ¹

, grave says, “sidonio est vox preconis ενφηνεῖν[ [incolere] Ju-
