μυρίαι κόραι Θηριΐισι τοῦμόν λέκτρον. εἴρηται τόδε. Canter
corrected the first line as it is now printed. The monstrous error,
γαμούντων, proceeding stom ignorauoe of the quantity 01¹⁴ εκᾶτι,
is removed m Barnes'‚ but unaccountably restored m Musgreve's
text. Thon, some editions place an interrogation aster λείιτρον;
Markland would read ἢ orl· Hermann prints οὖ instead of rit

ν. 865. η Κλνταιμνηστρα d ἐμοὶ Mdhtov' ἐπείσθη θυγα-
τὲρ indorum πόσα] Plain as these words sound, there hasbeen

a strange inclination to misunderstand them. The common version
renders μάλιστ ἐπείσθη facillime ρειιιιοια fuireet; Matthiae

unites in construction ε’πείσθη πόσει, adducta eet ο ιιιαιὶιοι and
finally Hermann objecta 'to the article being used with Κλντ.
as this speech, he says, is addressed to herself 3 he prints ei
Κλυταιμνήστρα (l, and connecting these words with the fol-
lowing lines, he renders them, ci Clytaemnestra propter me musitae
