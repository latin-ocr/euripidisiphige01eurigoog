muranum ru auus. 169

is translated postquam audiuit de morte, quom poter molitur,⁸ but
in Greek this sense would require φόνον and βουλεύει. Then
μνήμην d ἄρ’ εἶχον πλησίον βεβηκότος llos. τοῦδ’ is made
to assume this meaning, Feci autern mentionem prope accedentia
Agamemnonis hujus,· but ἔχειν μνήμην does not mean· facere

mentionem it bears a far different sense, memoriam seruare, asin
v. 1126. Matthiae hints at this last difficulty; he says, “Clytaem-
nestra haud dubie dicere voluit, sentire milri videor uenientem Agam·

Quomodo pro hoc dici potest μνήμην εἶχον (ε. ἐμνήσθην) 'Ay
πλησίον βεβηκότος ?” Hermann thinks to remove the scruple

. thus, “Non videtur (Matthiae) ad ἄρα attendisse. Exierat Cly-

taemnestra nt opperiretur Agamemnonem. Jam eum'conspicienS,
vidensque se bene meminisse quo tempore ille redire debuerit,
atque ergo, inquit, cmnmeminerom cum prope huc advmtore.” An
interpreter, who can make his way through such a difficulty as
this, will scarcely find anything in language to arrest his course.
All such ingenuity however, is here misplaced: Clytaemnestra had
no excuse for speaking of her memory on this occasion ; Aga·
memnon had not intimated any time for his return, he had not
been absent from the scene such a length of time, as could jus-
tify the words of the interpolator (borrowed from another play)
χρόνιον ἀπόντα, and it may be recollected that he and his wife
had parted in ill-humour, v. 649. And though Hermann alters
the translation of βεβηκότος from accedentis to adventantis, yet
I apprehend 'he will lind it almost as difficolt to justify the latter
as the former version of that participle. I will detain the reader
no longer with an exposure of this forgery3 the traces of which
if he does not pereeive after what has been said, all arguments
will he unavailing. 1 will only add that πόσιν in v. 999 was
substituted for some word which was construed with Ἀγαμέμ-
νονος. 1 have printed δέμας, as being a periphrasis common
with our. Author (see Hec. 712. Ἀλλ’ εἰσορῶ *γὰρ τοῦδε deo·
πότου δέμος Ἀγαμέμνονος) though some perhaps, from the
greater similarity of the words, may prefer πόδα, which is equally
Euripidean (seeOrest.1215. παρθένον δέχου πόδα). lt must be
remarked too that the translatore, in order to reconcile' the
beginning of this speech with what follows, render προσκοπου-
μεύη prospectore, while it really signifies prospiciens.
