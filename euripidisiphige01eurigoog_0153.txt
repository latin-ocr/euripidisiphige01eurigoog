ν’. 555. Aldus Πρδς ἐμοῦ ’γενοῦ νῦν, καί μη ’τί φροντίδας
τρέπου. Βο1 all the MSS. have παρ’ ἐμοί, and this is adopted
hy the editors since Markland. Barnes ejected καί μ being
destructive of the metre.

v. ⁵56. αλλ’ εἶμι MS. Vict. The Flor- 1. has οὖκ without the
conjunction: both these variations are for the worse.

v. 558. Ἰδοιί, γέγηθά σ’ sir γέγηίῖ ὁρῶν, τὲκνον] The
old' editions have idori, γέγηθ’ ἕως γέγηθά σ’ ὁρῶν, which is
palpably corrupt. 'l'he correction adopted by mc is Musgrave's;
Matthiae and Hermann have the same. Gaisford's reading, Ἰδού.
γέγηθί ὅπως ’γέγηθά σ’ εἰσορῶν, τέκνον, is further removed
from the common text3 and in this mode of speaking cis is pre·
’ sersus οὕτως. Senaefer (on soph. md. c. 273. νῦν t οὐδὲν siluis
ἱκόμην ἶν’ ἱκόμην) says, “Sic solent Graeci, quando de rebus in- .
jucundis brevi praecidunt? Elmsleyr adds, “Euripides Med.1011.

ν. 561. The common reading is Οὔκ οίδὸ τι φης, οὐκ οἶδα,
φίλτατ’ ἐμοί πάτερ, noris there found any variation in the written
copies. We have here a werse with an anapaest for the second, and
another for the fisth foot. Το remove these unlicensed intrudere,
Heath proposed d φης for 6 τι φης, and Markland oi for ἐμοί.
Both these corrections met with the approbation of Possm, and
are adopted into the text by Gaisford: but there does not seem
tome the least likelihood that either could have been written by
the Poet. ὅ τι is required atteroda οίδο, and φίλτατ’ ai πάτερ
could not be used instead ofsi φίλτατε πάτερ. There does not
appear any doubt that this verse has undergone reformation at the
haud of an ancient but ignorant corrector, who knew not that the
Tragia measure repudiates many licences which are familiar to
Comedy. In regard to the meaning of the line there is no difficulty.
The verse printed in my margin is only one of many suggestions
which might be made, for a probable restoration ol the words of
the Tragedian. Besides the metrieal enormities of the common
reading, 1 have grave objections to the language. liirst, the repeti-
tion of such words as minoida is highly suspicions ; secondly,
though oria οίδ 6 τι φης be a correct mode ol' speaking, as
σήμαιν’ 6 τι φης in ν. 126. yet it hardly seems to resch the
meaning of iphigenia, who would rather have said οὖκ οἶδ ὅ τι
