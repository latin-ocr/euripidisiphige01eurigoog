v. 627. Προτελεια6ἦ6 ηποι6 ος ςσφαξας θεᾷ, ] Respecting
προτελεὶα, see the note on ν. 856, and compare ν. 1008. θεοὶ rs
Diana, not, as Barnes' imagines, Juno. ’

ν. 628. Μέλλω,’ πῖ ταύτῃ roi καθέσταμεν τύχῃ] This
is a correction hy Heath, for μέλλω γ ἐπὶ ταύτῃ We are
indebted to the Aldine for the intrusive γ, which rs not found*
in the manuscripts.

v. 630. All the copies present Θῦσας ’γε θνραθ“’ οπερ μ
ἐχρῆν θῦσαι θεοῖς. This line being obviously faulty, Porson
proposed as corrections either ope* χρῆν, οι <inl χρῆ. The first
of these is adopted in the text hy Gaisford and approved hy

' Elmsley on Bacch. 824. As far as the rejection of περ, Iagree

with those great authorities3 it was inserted by some one who found
in the copy d ns χρῆν, and thought that the verse might be scanned
by the admission of an anapaest. Still 1 do not think that the Por·
sonian reading can be the true one3 nor yet that of Matthias, who
rejects the pronoun altogether and writes ἅπερ ἐχρῆν. In fact,
neither the emphatic pronoun ἔμε, ιιοι· the imperfect ἕχρῆν οι·
χρῆν suits the sense of the line. The latter point was, I think,
perceived by Porsen, when he proposed his second emendation
α’με χρῆ. Βιιι the sense requires d με χρῆ and nothing more.
My own idea therefore rs this. χρη and χρεῶν (rub. ἐστι) are
used indifferently, and the change of χρεών into χρῆν in the old
copies, is one of easy occurrence. l have therefore restored
Oriona γε θύμαθ’, d με χρεών θῦσαι θεοῖς. Another mode of
correction occurred to Faehse‚ θύσας ’γε θῦμ’ ὅπερ, and this is

adopted by Hermann, who forgets to mention that Faehse has tho
priority in this emendation.

v. 633. Καλῶς γ’, ἀναγκαίως τε· συνενέγκαι 6 ὅμως]
Aldus καλῶς 6, 6ιιι ιινο Paris and two Flor. MSS. omit the particle.
Some agree with ¹Heath in correcting κακῶς for καλῶς. But
καλός with ‘ys frequently serves to express irony. Ι have there-
fore preferred καλῶς γε. This answer expresses the mind of
clytemnestra Markland renders ooveve‘ytar 6 onos, prosit tamen.

The words of Agamemnon which follow make me suspect the '
true reading to be σννονὲχκαιμ.

ν. 634. Οἶσθ ονν ὁ Ἣ6ρᾶσον, ω γύναι ;] Examples of this
Atticism are collected by Elmsley on Soph. OEd T 543 to which
