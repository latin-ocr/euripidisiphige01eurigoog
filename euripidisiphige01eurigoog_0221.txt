Εἱ ’γαρ παρήσω τόνδε συλᾶσθαι βίᾳ Ξένον apsis o'wlpdc
βωμόν, criu ἐλευθέραν Οἰκεῖυ darriaco γαῖαν.

ν. 1171. 11 has hitherto been edited oi τέκνου, ti ξέναι. But
the reader may observe that clytemnestra no where else in the
whole play notices the women of the Chorus, aster her lirst ac-
knowledgement of their courteous salutation, when her carriage
drew up in the orchestra, and she alighted close to them. That
she should address them at this particular moment when her fecl-
ings are most agoniaed by despair at perceiving the certain fate
of her daughter, is surely not very probablc: and as what follows
is spoken to iphigenia alone, I have no hesitation in attributing
the words, ui ξέναι, to the interpolator, who has before been dis-
turbed at the Queen not payiug more attention to the Chalcidian
almogera, and to remedy this neglect, has inserted the lines which
used to follow v. 542. l have therefore printed ui τέκνου, oi
τέκνου, as in v. 1201. ui μᾶτερ, ὦ μᾶτερ.

v. 1172. Oi ’Ὑώ θανάτου τοῦ σοῦ μελέα] Aldus and the
other edd. ol ἐγώ, θανάτου σου. Heath first corrected it to
θ. roriconi, for the sake of the arrapoestic measure.

v. 1174. This line used to conclude with ταὺτό γαρ, re.
clamante lege συναφείας. Porson says, “ Dela ‘ydp ct lege ταῦτόν.”
'His orders have been obeyed by Gaisford, Hermann, and myself:
though 1 am not sure that we have done right in discarding γάρ.
Dobree would omit the second μῆτερ, and read ταὺτόυ γάρ δή.

v. 1178. This beautiful aud pathetic song of Iphigenia has
been roughly handled by ancient critics, and with little less vio-
lence by some moderas who have proposed metrical arrangements
of the verses. Seidler (De Vera. Daciam. p. 52) would make the
’ first part to consist of Dochmiacs, a species of verse of which 1
do not think that this Tragedy has a single instancer Elmsley (on
Med. 4. note) would force all the lines from the beginning down
to 1206. into the Trochaic measure. The arrangement which Ι
have adopted is that given by Monk in Cambridge Classical Ea·
ominatioas, p. 142. except in some particulare where 1 shall maintain
that a different reading is to be adopted.

v. 1179. Ι have ejected the words Ἴδας τ’ ὄρεα, as being
nothing more than an interpretation of Φρυγῶν νάπος, which
having been written in the margin, found its way, as osten hap·
pens, into the text. These words, besides their being a prosaic
explanation of a poetical expression, are clearly intrusive3 they in·
