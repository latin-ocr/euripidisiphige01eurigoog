dismiss the line therefore, only noticing, that instead of ἢ uri,
most MSS. have either idod or lionis: on which variation thore
who desire to correct the verse, must found their conjectures.

v. 899. “Recte Bromius intellexit sensum hunc esse: sed ιοιιιιιι
ιιοιι ultra quam ree patitur uerecundum esee oportet.'' Hermann.

v. 902. dp‘ydr ιον τῶν οἴκοθεν] There' rs a similar construc-
tion of οἱρὙ6ς in AEsch. Th. 407. Αἰσχρῶν γὰρ dp‘ydr, ιιη
raude 661 εῖναι θέλει.

v. 904. All the authorities grve οἵ τ dv. ἧς. lhave altered ης
ιο ἦν, and consider ἀνικέτευτος ιο be a passive verbal, like α’6ιο-
ριιτοι Hec. 42. orii* αοῶριιτος φίλιον Εστοι πρός ἆν6ρῶν. This
seems greatly preferable to Hermenn's ried, οι Vossius’s ιιν τ ης.

v. 907. Ωι”’ ενγ ἀκονσιισ ἰ’σθι ιιιιι1ιεν6Α ινιιι ’ἑρεῖν] Elmsley
(on Med. 580) illustrates this construction by similar instances. the
more ordinary syntax would bei fodr ιιη deod ως ιι ἐροῦντα.

Among other quptations are, Τιο. 916. α σ οι6α6ιο1λ6γιιιν”ιοντ
' ἑιιοι Κατηγοριίσειν. Soph. Electr. 616. Ev ννν ἐπίστω τῶν66
μ’ αἶσχννιιν Ιἔχειν.

v. 908. leviri he'ywv μὲν, καὶ ιιατην ἐγκερτομῶν] All the
copies have sicud ιι λέγων66τ Ihave substituted λέγων ιιέν, as
the sentence seems to require the opposition of μὲν and 66. Mat-
thiae however, mentions ‘ydp as the emendation of Hermann, who

does not introduce or allude to it in his own edition. lf the reader
prefers the latter particle, l interpose no objection.

v. 910. Ὄναιο, συνεχῶς 6νστνχοῐιιταο ὠφελῶν] Hermann
prints συνετῶς, which souuds feeble; end no fault is alleged against
the common reading συνεχῶς

ν. 911. commonly ἄκουε dn ννν. Bernes gives 6ιι ννν, which
is unquentionably right. deone 6ἧ νον οοοιιιο in v. 1042, and else·-
where. On the subject of the enclitic ινν, and its various uaages,
there is e full and discriminating discussion in an article of the
Philological Marcum, Vol ι. p. 227. a poper of uncommon learning
and judgmeut, which I have heard attributed to Mr John Words-
worth. the following uote applica to the present combination of

ιιιιιιὶοΙοιεί ‘Our younger readers must be careful to distinguish
between 6ιι ννν with an imperative end 6η ννν οι ννν 6η with ιιιι

indicative. Dr Elmsley has confouuded the uses of these adverbe
in his note on Soph. Aj. ι. 994. Odeis* θ ὁ6ῶν ποσῶν ιινιάσοσα
