though lt must be confessed ιλιι such an order of words rs
unusual, and ιλιι we should rather expect, oe'd, ιι πάρθενζ
oros d, ιο τλᾶμον, ορ dori κόρα. Ροιιιι seems to have
thought that the line ought to be supplied ιιι some such manner,
for he translates it, But ιλιι, ankappy mid, tty head With flomery

ν. 983 Aster 'Ap-peior, the MSS and old editions prpceed
thus, ‘y ἆλιᾶν ὥστε πετραίων όπ αντρων ἐλθοῦσαν ορένιν
μόσχον arriparoo. Instead of ’γ ilario, which rs s glaring
corruption, Scaliger discovered the true word to he βαλιὰν,
and joined it with μόσχον. Several editors have adopted this

suggestion, rendering it, ιιιαοιιὶοιαιιι juvencam. lhave inserted
the word ελαφον ιιι the text, for several concurring reasons.

1. βαλιοῖ rs a common epithet of ελαφος, but not so of μόσχοι.
Hec 88. Eld ον ’γὰρ βαλιὰν ελαφον λῦκον niuosa χαλᾷ.
Hipp. 218. Βαλιαις ελόφοις εγχριμπτομένη· 2. If all the
words cited be referred to μόσχον, the sentence is overloaded
and embarrassed. 3. Ιι is most likely that the Chorus, when
comparing the treatment of Iphigenia to that of ιιι ordinary vic·

· tim, would not forget ιλιι animal which, as the fable says, the

goddess herself supplied as the most appropriate substitute on
her altar. 4. 'l'he metres, as they stand in all the editions, are
not reconcileable with those of the rest of this chorus, or with
any others used λγ οιιι· author, whereas, by the insertion of
ελαφον, and of η before μόσχον, the verses become at once
assimilated to the prevailing measure of the chorusses of this play.
Professor Hermann holds quite a different opinion, and thinks
that he has set all right by giving τόν ἁλίαν, and construing
thus: Επιστέψονσι σε’, inquit, τόν οἷλὶαν ἑλθονσαν,“ wore
μόσχον α’κηρατον ἀπό πετραιων corpur ὀρείων Although
1 entertarn many objections to this proposition, I shall mention
only one: οἱλῖα may be ι good epithet for a sea-goddess, hut
Iphigenia had not corne from the sea, nor had the Chorus reason
to suppose that she had ever been on that clement in her life.

v. 985. lhave given ὀρείαν for όρὲιον, ι word for which it
might be easily mistaken, and have inserted 'l for the reasons
already stated. Both sense and metre repudiate όρέωντ Her·
mann changes it to dpslwv: the reader must decide.
