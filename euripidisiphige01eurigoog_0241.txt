to the simplicity of those times, confessed to be so, on her promised
nuptiale. The cause of such destination too, as appeared at first,
was the private family interest of Menelaus. All this justifies, or
rather demands, the strongest expression of female fear and warh„
ness. But she aflerroords recants, aad voluntarily devotas herseff to
the altor. And this, with the same strict attention to probability.
She had now informed herself of the importance of the case. Her ’
devotement was the demand of Diana, and the joint petition 'of all
Greeoe. The glory of her country, the dignity and interest of her
family, the life of the generous Achilles, and her own future fame,
were all nearly concerned in it. All this considered, together with
the high, heroic sentiments of those times, and the superior merit,
as was believed, of voluntary devotement, Iphigenia's character
must have been very unfit for the distress of a whole tragedy to
turn upon, if she had not, in the end, discovered the readiest sub-
mission to her appointment” As each reader will exercise his own
judgment upon this question, 1 shall only further state that Twyning,
who is disposed to join in Aristotle's censure of Euripides on ac-
count of the suddenness of the change in Iphigenia’s sentimenta,
admits that it would not have been fairly applicable but for the·
unfortunate conclusion of her speech (v. 1146) univeros d, de
εὔχεται Θανεῖν· κακῶς ζῇν κρεῖσσον ἢ θανεῖν καλῶοε which
words he thinks that Aristotle had particularly in view. However
this might have been, it is but fair to remark that Euripides was
then only putting into his own verses a well known passage of
Homer, where the Shade of Achilles says, Βονλοίμην κ’ ἐπάρουρος
dciv θητευέμεν ἄλλῳ Ἁνθρὶ παρ’ ἀκλήρῳ, ᾧ μή βίοτος nohis εἵη,
Ἢ πᾶσιν νεκύεσσι καταφθιμένοισιν ἀνάσσειν. Odyss. A. 488.

⁴ v. 1353. The 'verses with which the play concludes are forced
by Seidler and Hermann into an antistrophic form, if that term can
properly be given to such schemas as the following: Seidler (De
Vera. Dochm. p. 285) makes v. 1353-137511 Strophe, v. 1388 tothe
end an Antistrophe‚ and the intervening lines a Mesode. Hermann
makes two Strophes, two Antistrophes, and three Epodes. Both
arrangements are effected by means of omissione, transpositione,
and other violent changes, in which the object aimed at is tlte cor·
respondenoe of metre, rather ‘than the propriety oflanguage or
sentiment. lt is unnecessary to 'state the particulars of those
changes, as I do not acknowledge the soundness of the principle
upon which they are made,- and am far from being convinced,
