this form, Ti τὸ δίκαιον rods-'3 ἆρ’ ἔχοιμεν τοῖσδ’ α’ντοῖπὲῖν
inoffi others strove to reduce it to something like rhythm by
writing τοῦτό γ’, and erasing τοῖσδ’.

v. 1279. Elc‘y οἱνῆρ κρείσσων γυναικῶν μυρίων ὂρᾷν φάος]
Dobree proposes ὁρῶν for ὁρᾷντ but the latter rs right, the con-
struction being the sameas in Orest. 795. Ως ανὴρ ὅστις τρο·
τοῖσι συντακῇ, θυραῖος ων, Μαρίων κρείσσων ομαίμων α’νδρί
κεκτῆσθαι qhdtos. Hermann omits the ‘y alter sic, and Ι was
once tempted to do the same; for though the particle' rs not un-
meaning, yet without it I think the sentence would have run
better. One Paris MS. has eis ‘yolp α’νήρ.

ν. 1281. The old copies have ’μνήσομ’ ε’·γῖί, which error was
first corrected by Reiske.

v. 1284. To the same effect arethe words of Macaria, Heracl.
591. Tal' αντι παίδων εστί μοι κειμήλια

ν. 1285. Βαρβάρωνί ‘'Essenos'' αρχειν eirds] Aldus and
the MSS. eisds αρχειν. Dan. Heinsius first pointed out that the
measure required those two words to be transposed. It 1s cor·
rectly quoted by Aristotle Polit 1. 2.

ν. 1286. τό μὲν, ie. το βάρβαρον γενος.

’ ν. 1288 Ph. 1217. Καλως τα των θεων και τοὶ της τνχης οχον

ν. 1289. μακαρίον μέ τις θεῶν’ Εμελλε θήσειν, ει τνχοιμι
σῶν γάμων] The common version is incorrect, deatum me Deo-
roan uliquis facturns esset, si tuus nuptias possem labere. It ought
tube, beatum me facturus erat, si mini nnptioe ἱνα contigissent.

ν. 1291. τοῦ μένΑ111.111111 MSS. One Paris MS. has σοῦ super-
scribed, which also appears in Canter's edition.

After ν. 1292 follow two lines which I have degraded to the
bottom of the page: Td θεομαχεῖν ’γαρ deonerare? o σου κρα-
τεῖ, Εξελογίσω τα χρηστα, ‘ru' τ ἀναγκαῖα ys. The editors
differ in reading, some ταναὙκαῖα γε, others τάναγκαῖά τε, but
not one of them has intimated a suspicion of these lines not being
genuine. N evertheless Iam persuaded that no person can read this
play without feeling their impropriety. They destroy the effect of
what Achilles has just said, and reduce his admiration of the young
princess's noble spirit and generous patriotism, to a mere compli-
ment' on her prudence in surrendering to necessity. This sentiment
is so' unlike his character, and so'inconsistent with what he' says
before and asterwards, that it might safely' be deemed an inter·
