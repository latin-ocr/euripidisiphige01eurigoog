148 ΝΟΤΕ8 ΟΝ THE

not have here written θύγατερ, without the interjection. uiti-¹

' ’γατερ is certainly more agreeable to usage, particularly in the'

beginning of a speech, and the invocation of an absent person: still
there are various passages which make me hesitate in declaring the
other illegitimate. Both the Paris MSS. omit the first roi, so do·
the Florentine3 but the latter give σὴ instead of σύ. Markland
prefers χὴ μήτηρ σέθεν, but without good reason. Compare
Hipp. 658. καὶ σι) καὶ δέσποινα σῆ.

v. 790. Οἵχνιιιιι τάλαινα δάκρυον ὄμματ’ οὐκέτι στέγει]
The editions before Barnes have δακρύοντ’ : he printed δάκρυόν τ’,
but proposed two various lectione, δάκρυ τ’ and δάκρυά τ’. Mat-
thiae, believing, like Barnes, that δάκρυόν τ’ was contro nestrum,
omits the τ’. 1 agree with him in his emendation, though not

in his reason. The sentence gains in spirit, and the verse in har-
mony, by the absence of the Copula.

v. 791. Εἴπερ ἀλιγεινδν τδ τέκνων στερομένην δακρυρ-
ροεῐν] Understand ori πάσχεις ἀλγεινά.

ν. 793. Compare note on v. 116.

v. 796. Κᾷτα πῶς φέρων ’γε δέλτον oris ἐμοὶ δι’δως λα-
βεῖν;] Porson has this note: “Omni venere caret particula. Lege
κᾷτα πῶς φέρων σι) idaeos? This change Gaisford adopts, and
Elmsley quotes with approbation, because it takes away one instance

opposed to his canon, that ‘ys is not used in interrogative sentences.
But the truth is that the particle has here no share in the question
itself, but gives‘a very considerable force to the word which it
follows: φέρων γε δέλτον means carrying, aa you aoy, α rehtu.
Matthiae and Hermann properly retain it

v. 797. Μενέλεως ἀφείλεθ’ ἡμᾶς, δε κακῶν τῶνδ’ cirros]
Med· 333. Ζεῦ, μα’ λάθοι σε τῶνδ decimos rarior: on the strength
of which quotation Porson proposed to alter the order of the con·
cluding words in this verse of the Iphigenia to τῶνδ’ iis alnoo
κακῶν. But there seems no sufficient cause for so doing. In the
line of the Medea, the metre requires this latter order3 in oure,
the sense makes it natural that ds should precede the other
words.

v. 801. Μέμφοιιαι κάγῶ πόσει σῷ, κούχ ἅπλῶς οὕτω φέρω]
The latter words are rendered in the translation, neque ita leuiter
fero. But otro means something more, and seems to imply,
as Agamemnon aspecta. Compare Heracl. ³75, οὖχ offered δοκεῖς
