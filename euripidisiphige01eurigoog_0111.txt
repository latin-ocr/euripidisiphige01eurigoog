80 NOTFS ΟΝ ΤΗΕ

v. 76. Aldus and the other old editors place a full stop at
the end of v. 75. and rea'd Μενέλαος ονν καθ ι’1Ξ1λλιίδ οιστ pricos

μόνος. But all the MSS. have Μενέλαον. o di καθ’ Elhltrid

οἰστρήσας μόρῳῑ this restores the true reading, exceptas coucems
the last word, for which Aldus seems to have substituted μόνος
upon conjecture. Instead of μόρῳ, Markland proposed a number
of guesses, and among the rest ρομῳ, without bsrng himself aware
that he had here hit upon the true word. δρόμῳ, saith spread, isfre-
quently used' rn a similar way-in v. 850. ερχοται δρόμῳ. Orest.
716. δρόμῳ στείχοντα. Ion. 1⁵76. δρόμῳ σπείσασῖ Bacch. 747.
ἀρθεῖσαι δρόμῳ. The error seems to have arisen from the acci·

dental omission or obliteration of the first letter; another han-
scriber finding ρόμῳ, vaona nihili, changed it by transposition of
two consonants into μόρῳ.

v. 79. μίξαντες δορί] Porson compares ἐλθόντος δορί, Aris-
toph. Lys. 1158. This line appears in Aristode, Rhet. 111. ιι. 2.
where instead of δορί rs read ποσί, and this Musgrave adopts,
very erroneously; even the MSS. of Aristotle have δοροί.

80. στενόπορα refers to the narrowness of the strait of the
Euripus3 aa in v. 1878. Αὐλίδος στονοπόροισιν ὅρμοις. and ν. 168.
στενόπορθμον Χαλκίδα.

v. 82. Ἵπποις τε πολλοῖς ἅρμασίν τ’ ἠσκημένοι] The cor-
rectiora of this line is due to Reiske. The editions till recently
continued to give anhlote θ ἅρμασίν ιῳί some MSS. omit γ’,
which' rs an evident expletive.

v..83 The editions have κάμὲ orpurrrysav κᾷτα Μενέλεω
χόριν, where κᾷτα (Ald. κᾶτα)’ rs a palpable corruption, which
it is the more difficult to correct, because a substitute for that word,
however necessary for the verse, is not required hythe sense. Of
all the proposed emendations (and they are very numerous) that
of Heath‚ κάρτα, seems by sar the most probsble, and 1 have
accordingly adopted ir, as Hermann has done, although I cannot
leel quite as much confidente as he expresses in its certainty.

v. 84. This passage and vv. aaa-263 are the authority of Eusta-
' thius for ssying that Agamemnon was an elected commender p 87.

30. ότι diercis Ἀχαιοῖς ἐξ asperatur ἦν Baccheis ο Ἀγα-
μέμνων, Εὐριπίδης όν Ἰφιῳενείᾳ δηλοῖ σαφέστατα. Again

185. 3. το δι’ πολλοῖς νήσοις καί Ἄργεϊ παντί ἀνάσσειν,
del'yuiil εστι τοῦ μη ἁπλῶς χειροτονητδν εἶναι ε’ίτ οὖν αἱρετόν
