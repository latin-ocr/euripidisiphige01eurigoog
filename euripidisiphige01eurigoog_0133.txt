102 NOTES ΟΝ ΤΗΕ

Paris M'SS. have ὥνόμαξας (not ,ὠνομᾶξαις as Markland says)
omitting ποτ’, and so have the other copies according to Matthiae.
It would appear therefore that ποτ’ was the insertion of Aldus.

Markland properly reads ὠνόμαζες, appellabas, which form is more
commonia such cases than the aorist. Eur. Suppl. 1224. παῖς
τ’ ἀπ’ Αἱτιολῶν μολιδν Τυδέως, δν ὠνόμαζε Διομήδην πατήρ.
, Heracl. 87. Ὀνομα τί σε, γέρον, Μυκηναῖος ὠνόμαζεν hardu

to which the memory of the reader will probably supply many
additions.

v. 340. σῆς Κλυταιμνηστρας δέμας] Elmsley proposes (ιη’,
Κλυταιμνήστρα, δάμαρ, and this rs adopted by Hermann m his
text. 1 should not choose to alter a poetieal' into a common mode
of speaking. Compare Orest. 107. Τὶδ” ονχι θυγατρὸς Ερμιόνης
πέμπεις δέμαςς ,

v. 341. Και παῖς ΗΟρέστης, ως συ τερφθειης ι dciv] ως σν
is my emendation for the common reading ὥστε, which does not
express the meaning of the speaker. If any zealous supportet of
the Canons of Dawes should make a difficulty at finding the optative
τερφθείης following the present ὁμαρτεῖ, he may observe that
the rule rs not in fact violated; for though ὁμαρτεῖ only ις ex-
pressed, yet, that word being applied to the child Orestes, we under-
stand ἐκομίσθη, or δωμάτων ἐξεπέμφθη, or something of the kind
Hermann gives dic τι τερφθείηςδ ι ων, which 1 think rather feeble.

v. 343. ως μακρὰν ετεινον] quam hagam carperent viam. Soph.
Aj. 1040. Μη τεῖνε μακρᾶνμ ¹flisch. Agam. 1267. μακρὰν ετεινιις.
Markland wished to read ευρρυτου, but Matthia justly remarks
that ρ is not doubled aiter diphthongs

v. 345. αὗται τε πῶλοίγ Aldus ς and so commonly. Mark-
land corrected it to πῶλοί τ’, though he himself thought that
the true reading was αυται *γε πώλοις. This was to be sure a

strange device. I used formerly to consider thet we ought to
adopt αυταῖσι πώλοις along with Porson, (who by the way wrote,

whether intentionally or by mistake I cannot pronounce‚ the mascu-
line αυτοῖσι) agreeably to that well known Atticism, which so many

scholare have illustrated, and no one so fully as Elmsley on Med
160. But whoever considers attentively the' ‚instances given in his

note, will probably prefer' 1n this passage αυται τε πῶλοί τ, an
Homeric mode of speaking. Odyss Δ. 20 αὐτώ τε και ιππιν
