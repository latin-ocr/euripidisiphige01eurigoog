namnum ru aunis. 167

v. 987. Βρότειον αἱμάσσοντες λοιμὸν] This line cannot be
reconciled to any metre with which Ι am acquaiuted3 it also
seems unnecessary aud intrusive.⁵l do not insinuate that it is
the offspring of the interpolator, for the words are not likely to
be his; but I do think it very probable that they were taken
from some passage of our author, now lost. The reader will observa
that the part. praes. αἱμάσσοντες does not suit the context*.

v. 988. All editions have οιί σιίριὙὙι τραφεῖσαν· oli ἐν
ῥοιβδήσει βουκόλων, and it is rendered aon ad Jialaloe sonum aa·
tritam, neque ad contemporanea. Whereas ῥοίβὸησις deuotes not

the songs of the herdsmen‚ but the lowing of the herda: Ι have
therefore given βουκολιῶν, which restores both sense and verse.

Apollon. Rh. 1. 627. Βονκολίαι τε βοῶν, armenta ίοννι.

ν. 990. ΑΙιΙαε and the Edd. παροί ‹le' μητέρι νυμφοκόμον
Ἰναχίδαις γάμον, the two last words being rendered acorem
alicui Argivorum. Markland seems to have perceived that νυμφο-
κόμον was a proper epithet not of the bride, but of the mother;
the word is in fact synonymous with ννμφαγιογὸς, which Cly-
taemnestra applies to herself in ν. 528. Ι have therefore given

π. d. ματρί ννμφοκόμιρ, and have placed marks of hiatus in the ,

following line. Without the insertion of a word of two syllables
the metre cannot stand, and such an epithet as charada, or sedada,

would raise the spirit of the sentence, while it restored its harmony.
Ἰναχίδαις γάμον, οε Hec. 352. Boccheuor νιίμφη.
v. 992. In all the copies the following lines appear,
ποῦ τιί τᾶς αἰδοῦς,
[ἢ cd τᾶς α’ρετιῐς δύνασιν ἔχει
σθένειν τι πρόσωπον]
- ἲίίτοτε τᾶἰιὲν ἄσεπτον, &c

What is placed between brackets seems the productiori of the -
interpolator ; nevertheless‚ 1 have retained πρόσωπον, from my un-

willingness to eject any word which might by possibility belong to

our Poet. The interpolator hae not given himself the trouble Δ

of looking beyond the next two lines for the other words of his
addition to the chorus3 and consequently he is, if possible, more

' Possibly such a sentence as the following might have existed in a lost
Trogody, or in the lost speech of Diana at the conclusion of the Iphigenia:

βρότειον αἱμάσσοντες ἀμφήκει ξίφει
λαιμόν. ·
