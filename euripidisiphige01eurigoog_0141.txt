tiu εἰσέρχεταις which' rs palpably wrong. The Mss. have“ o τι

of the MSS But 1 agree with Hermann 1n thinking that this was
only a correction for the sake of the mette, and that the indefinite
ὅστις cannot be used for the simple relative. He has properly

therefore adopted Markland's emendation ὤμ’, though he has
forgotten to name its author.

v. 443. Ὃν μή σι) φράζεις, πῶς ὑπολάβοιμ’ ἂν λάιγον4]
This is the correction of Markland for the common reading virro-
λάβοιμεν λάιγον; Let the reader compare with this passage
Iph. Τ. 658. where Orestes says, Πυλάδη, πέπονθας ταύτά, apris
θεων, suoi3 Pylades replies. Ονι( old‘⁷ ερωτᾷς ον λέγειν’ εχονπά
με These are two instaures, among a multitude, of that studied

or affected simplicity of sentiment in Euripides, which was a con-
stant topic of censure and ridicule among his rivals and detractors.

areunculam usi πέφυκε, τοῦ ’γ άχλον μέτα] This
is the common reading. Reiske''s1s τον π οχλον μέτα, which

Matthiae and Hermann have adopted. I consider the common text ⁴

4ο be more simple. πον οχλον μέτα 14 not, as the interpreters
translate rt, apud populum, (for that would be τῳ οχλῳ πάρα) but
ubi e uulgi partibas atat.

v. 448. Ονκονν dorsis νιν &c.] Aldus ονκονν δάκει νυν.
For νῦν, Canter edited νιν. Musgrave discovered that the true
reading was δοκεῖς cum interr. For οὔκουν we are indebted 4ο
Gaisford. l consider that ονἰιοῦν, quamobrem, never had any place
in the writings of the Tragedians ; yet it is retained in their text
by both Matthia and Hermann.

ν. 450. lirim ψεύδομαι, 44 the end of a Senarian lambic, is
in opposition to the Porsonian canon on the Pausa. He himself

(Sappl. Proef. ud Hoc. p ,xxx1.) cites this, and two other verses,
Hec. 717. Ημειςμένοννὲιομεν, ον dirivationem Andr. 346. ‘bouyer
τά ταύτης σῶφρον άλλά ψεύσεται· adding‘ ‘Et hos tres versus,
cum eodem morbi generasi lumea morburt ert, laborent, juniorum
sagacitati commendo.” Accordingly, many a young critic has tried
his hand at amending these verses. But I do not think that Porson
was speaking seriously, or that he really wished the received read-
ings 4ο be disturbed3 for he adds elsewhere,‘ ‘Satis ostendi, ut
opinor, quod promisi, paucissimos Tragicorum esse versus similes
