γοναὶ, Καὶ φιλότεκνόν πως πᾶν γυναικεῖον γένος. The usage
'oi decada is the semein AEsch. Prom. 39. To* συγγενές τοι decada,
ἥθὸμιλία. Andr. 985 Ιιιν. 819 some MSS. have φέρειν.

ν. 821. Υψηλόφρων ιιοι Oouds oips'vcr πρόσω] For
πρόσω Hermann gives arpocda, which, 1 confess, appears to me
lamentably flat. Matthiae observes on this and the two next lines

“ιιψηλόφρων” caperat πρόσω, i..e νψηλόφρων eset-111 sqq.
μετρίως etad α’σχαλᾷν et ad χαῖρειν spectare videtur Magni

greve observes thet our Poet rs herc smitating Archilochus (Stob
xx.) ἀλλὰ χαρτοισὶν τε χαιρε, roi κοκοισιν ἆσχᾶλο Μή Aina
He wishes to read ἐπίσταμαι for ἐπίσταται.

ν. 8245 Λελογισμινρι γᾶρ οι τοιοίδ’ cacia βροτῶν, Ορ-
dado danzeio τον βίον, γνώμης odra] These two verses are com-
monly assigned to the Chorus, but they unquestionably form part
of the speech of Achilles: this was first notioed by a writer in the
Classical Journal (v01.1 p. 112.) whom I apprehend to be Mr
Burgus. In the explanation of these lines, there have been some
great failures‚ and not the least rs that oi Matthiae, who removes
the comma alter βροτῶν, and Joins λελογισμένοι εἱσι διαζῇν,
acholio quast subductis constituerant ciam. λελογισμενος rs used
here as an adjective, and means discreet; see v. 807. and v. 928
,ιλαζῆν rs an instance of an infinitivo disjoined from the consuuc-
tion, which ss by nemesus unfrequent.

ν. 826. Stiblinus compares Soph. Aj 554. Εν τῷ φρονεῖν
’γὰρ μηδ εν ἥ λιστος βιος

ν. 881. Πεισόμεθᾞ οταν 66 μη καλῶς, ον ’ποῖσομαι] The
last word of this line ιιι Aldus and following editions rs πεισόμεθα
Barnea edited acciacum, as Scaliger had suggested3 and such rs
the actual reading of the MSS

ν..888 Aldus Ἄρει τῳ aar ἐμέ. This error was corrected

by Brodoeus, who perceived that ιι ought to be Ἄρη το κατ ἐμὲ.
One of the Paris MSS. whichl have inspected, has Ἄρη, the other

‘Apis Gaisford rs, Ι believe, the only editor who has printed
Ἄρην, the proper form of the accusative. See Porson Phoen. 134.
Ιιι AEachyl.. Theb. 45. metrum postulat Ἀρην.

ν..884 Barnea prints the line thus; 266, ιιι ’παθονσα σχέ-

τλια ιι. τ. φ. an emendation which, though perhaps uunecessary,
