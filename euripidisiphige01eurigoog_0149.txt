v. 530. Dr Blomfleld would prefer ἀγαναῖς χερσὶν, and in
sintela1 following line μή ταρβὴσιιμεν. Ι cannot agree with him in
er er case.

v. 591. Md ταρβήσῃ τό νεωστὶ μολόν Τόδε κλεινόν τέκνον
Ἀγαμεμνόνιον] Ι have given τό νεωστὶ μολόν in place of the
common reading νεωστί μοι μολόν, as l do not concur with
Markland's doctrine that venor-i may be a dissyliahle. τόδε for
τό is the emendation oi' Blomfield, Ἀγαμεμνόνιον for Ἀγαμέμνονος
oi' Markland. =

v. 528. Commonly μή δέ θόρυβον. Gaisford and Blomfield
restore the metre by reading naid αὖ θόρυβον. But 1 prefer the
correction os Markland, ud δὴ θόρυβον, and Hermann does the
same. The words, ταῖς Ἀργείαις, which follow, might safely be
pronounced to be a mere gloss or scholium interlined over ξείναις,
even if the matre had not proved the necessity of their rejection.

v. 525. Ὀρνιθα μὲν τόνδ’ αἴσιον ποιούμεθα] Valckenaer on
Phoen. 865, and on Herod. p. 590. reads τόδ for τόνδ’ , ιι οοιτεο·’
tion which has met with the approbation oi' Musgrave and Porson,
and is received into thc text by Gaisford. It would have been much
better not to have disturbed the common reading, at which none
can justly take offense. It means, Ι regcrd tlu'r οινιαιι αι suspiciosa.
Compare Orest 778. οόιιουν οὗτος οἰωνός μόγαος

v. 530. Barnea is mistalren in reading εὐλαβούμεναι. The
Queen is now giving her orders, not to the Chalcidian women, but
to her own servants.

ν. 531. Sd δ, ιδ τέκνον μοι, λεῖπε πωλικοδς όχους]
Matthiae and Hermann stop the sentence thus, od δ, ὦ τέκνον,
μοι λεῖπε τ. ο. that μοι may belong to λεῖπε. But the common
punctuation is preferable, ιδ τέκνου μοι being used ford τόκνον
ἐμόν, asin Alcest. 823. Σδ δ’, ὦ τέκνον μοι, πῶς κορευθῆσοι

ν. 533. Helen. 1548. ἁβρόν πόδα τιθεῖσ’. Alter v. 5621

have ejected two verses, which betray the hand of the Interpoiator
too clearly to admit of their remaining in the text 3

ὑμεῖς δι’ νιανὶδαισιν- α”γκόλαις ότι
δέξασθε, καὶ πορεύσατ’ ἐξ ὀχημάτων.
It would be enough to excite suspicion that Clytaemnestra should

first admonish her daughter that in slighting from the carriage she
must step cautiously‚ and then immediately desim the young
