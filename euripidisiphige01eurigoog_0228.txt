only an error from the⁴ first letter of Clytaemnestra's name being
taken into the words of the Poet. But Hermann says, radis est
Heothii emendatio: nam necessarium est κούδεὶς-υἱοὶ dicotur ‘ri d't
οὐδεὶς-σοι ἦ οὐδεὶς-ῥ’ 1 do not accede to this dictum.- καὶ
would be suitable‚ but not necessary3 οὐδεὶς δὲ would be more
agreeable to usage; but the Tragedians‚ like all other writers,
sometimes give force to their sentences by omitting conjunctions.
Hermann adopts Musgrave's alternative conjecture σφάξαι σφε,
an alliteration very distressing to the ear.

v. 1235. Ald. and MSS. have Ἐς θόρυβον ἐγώ τοι rolris
ἤλυθον. Κ. ἐς τίν’, dr ξένος witha double infractiori of metre.
Heath and Markland would prefer ἦλθον, though they do not
seem to have perceived that the dactyl was absolutely inadmis-
sible. The other error it is very difficolt to remove in asatis·
factory manner. Markland proposes ἔγωγε καύτός. Musgrave
ε’·γῶ τι κ’ αὑτός. Blomfield ἐγώ τιν’ αὐτος. Porson and Mat⁴
thiae adopt Markland's. Gaisford and Hermann give Musgrave’s.
l have with much hesitation admitted Blomfield’s3 but am now
of opinion that Markland's is the safer correction: Dobree cites
ἐ”γωγε καὶ on'rds from Plato Gorg. p. 245. 10. Routlt.

v. 1236. The old edd. have μῶυ κόρην σώζειν ἐμῆν; Canter
first perceived that the true reading must be σώζων. lt implies,
What? in endeavouring to preserve my daughter?

v. 1237. All the translations render rie d dv ἔτλη by qais
vero ausus ert? lt should be quis vero ausus esset?

v. 1238. στρατὸς δὲ Μυρμιδόνων οὔ σοι wopau] This line
exhibite one instance of a dactyl in Troch. tetram. comprised in
a proper name; v. 784. has another, Εἲς ἄρ’ Ἰφιγένειαν Ἑλένης
νόστος ἦν τετρωμένος; Elmsley in his Review of Porson’s He-
cuba (Edinb. Rev. Vol. xrx. p. 71) while he -allows to any place
of Tragic iambics except the last, the licence of an anapaest
when entirely comprised in a proper name, wishes to deprive the
trochaic of the corresponding liberty: although the reason is pre·
cisely the same in both cases, that many names, like that of our
Heroine, could not otherwise come into the dialogue. Accordingly
he thinks these two lines corrupt. l mention this only to protest
against this disposition to limit the Tragic licences so much more
uarrowly than Porson has done, and to say that the existence of
but few instances is an insufficient argument in favour of a change.
