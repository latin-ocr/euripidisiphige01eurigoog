74.. NOTES ΟΝ ΤΗΕ

Hermann remarka‘ ‘At quid cogit μεσσηρης proprie dictum acci-
pere de stalla medio m coelo stante? Immo quod additum est ἔτι
prodere videtur, superlatione quae consueta est familiari sermoni,
μισσηρη nihil aliud significare, quam nondum proximum occasui
esse Sirium, necdum' ιιι eo ut mergi Oceano videatur: qua dicendi
figura eo credibilius est senem uti, quod se intempestive e cubili
excitatum esse moleste fert, ιι 'Hesychius ubi apud eum μεσσόρης
legitur, μεσσήρης, ut conjiciunt, curn hac interpretatione posuit.
ο με’σος ὠκεανοῦ aci ov'povov ‘roaros accommodatissima haec
explicatio est ei, quarn putamus Euripidis verborum sententiam
esse.’' All the old editions ἀΐσσων, eontra metram,- most ol the
modern ones ᾄσσων, erroneously‚ as if the α were long.

v.10,11. In every previous edition these words are given to
Agamemnon. But they seem. distinctly ιο belong to the Old
Servant, who is arguing against the fitness of their leaving tha
house at that unseasonable hour

The lines which follow, σνγαι ⁸'h' aviano To'vle κατ Ενριπον
εχονσιν. Τι’ la* eorl σκήνηι ἕκτος diocese, Ἀγάμεμνον ἄναξς
have occasioned much trouble to the Editors and Critics3 but 1
am not aware that any one of them has suspected the whole to
be an interpolation: yet they contain strong marks of spuriousness.
The words perplex and embarrass the conversation; the mention os
σκηνη betrays the forgery‚s1nce the action of the play rs not before
a tant, but1n front of the house' ιιι Aulis, ιιι which the king was
residing‚· and the Interpolator had ιιι view the first scene of the

Hecuba, where Agamemnon and the other principal characters are
dwelling ιιι tenta. Resides, the question of the Servant, ri ‹le

orl σκ. would be impertinentes he had already asked ‘ri de
καινουργεῖς, Ἀγάμεμνον ἅναξς and the actual meaning of the .

interpolated words is, Well, aad why are you horteniag out <ff tle
tent? a question which would be absurd in the mouth oi the serv-
ant, who had just corne οιιι of doors to join his master, already
standing in front of the house. Μοιοονέτ, the intrusive words betray

their origin: the Poet could not have used σιγαὶ in the plural:

ἆΐσσειν is very seldom a trisyllable (See Porson Hac. 31): and

the Interpolator has here, as in other parts of this play, borrowed

words from the neighbouring lines which were before his eyes.

Finally, a paroemiac is unsuitable in this place. When these'
lines are removed, all the difficulty and embarrassment os the

passage vanish at once.
