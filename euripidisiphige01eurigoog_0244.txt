no one is it reconcileable to the language. The particles τοι aud

like 1371. and such changes ought not to be made solely to pro-
duce similarity among adjacent metres. Seidler and Hermann give
the four lines 1365-68 to Iphigenia: this is, Ipresume, on account
of ω πότνια πότνια μᾶτερ, which words however are in truth
' more suitable 30 the Chorus than the daughter, the latter would

v 1369 In all other editions, this and the four following lines
are assigned to Iphigenia But' ι3 must strike any oue who attende
to the oeconomy 01 the scene, that they are inappropriate to her:
they express nothing more than the request which ,she had already
made to the women 01 31ιο Chorus, that they would jain in cele-
brating Diana in a song. This request is here repeated, but not
in the same strain 01 enthusiasm, and accompanied only by an
allusion to the position 01 Chalcis, on the side of the Euripus
opposite to Aulis. Iphigenia's knowledge 01 geography is repre-
sented by the Poet to have been very slender; witness her inquiry
about the position 01 Phrygia v. 571: besides she could hardly

have known that these semeles were natives of Chalcis3 and if she Ι

had, her mention 01 that place would be unnatural at a moment
when about to quit all earthly soenes 1οι ever. But let these lines
be given to the Chorus, asin my text, and the allusion becomes
plain'and appropriate. The principal singer first addresses a few
words to Clytaemnestra, who remains Ιοιι the stage absorbed iu
t'ears and misery, and then calls upon her companions to comply
with the invitation 01 the unhappy sufferet, and join in a song to
the presiding deity of Aulis, a place adjacent to their own city.
v. 1371. One line at least must have been lost, in which was

’γᾶν οι· ’γαῖαν οι· πέδον, οι something 01 the kind, with which
the adj. duria-opor agreed. That word is the epithct, not 01 Diana
but, 01 a place or regiones in every other instance where it is
