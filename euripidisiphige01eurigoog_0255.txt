224 NOTES ΟΝ THE

Dr Gaisford, the Dean of Christ Church, in his republication of
Markland's three plays of Euripides, should have confined himself
so much to putting forth the lucubratione of othere, and have
given eo little of his own criticism. Forsan, Elmsley, and Blom-
lield have severally written notes and emendations, which have
contributed much towards the improvement of the text 3 but the
first of those scholare composed his notes while a very young man ς
and an ample field has been left by them all for the further
amendment of this Tragedy.* A critical attention to the practice
of the Poet and his contemporaries, the comparison of similar
passages, and particularly a consideration of the probable causes
of corruption in the copies, arethe means wherebyl hope that a
purer text has been at length recovered.

Not long after the investigation of which 1 speak, my attention
was entirely engaged by other pursuitc and dissimilar occupa-
tione. So completely have 1 been obliged to renounoe claeeical
criticism, that 1 have not read and scarcely know by name any
writings of that kind which have appeared during the last twenty
years. Nevertheless the intimate acquaintance once formed with
the text of thie Iphigenia prevented its being obliterated from
my memory either by timeor other avocatione: whenever I have
been able to enjoy the recreation of reading Attia Greek, this picae
hae been present to my mind3 and 1 have thus been able to cor-
rect or confirm my opinions as to the purification of the text and
the explanation of its difficulties.

Any design which I might once have entertained of publication
had been long abandoned, when a learned friend with whom I
accidentally conversed upon the subject of the Iphigenia in Aulis,
having inspected my corrected copy, strongly exhorted me to print
it ς ae my so doing would, he thought, introduce to the notice of
studente a tragedy at present little read in colleges and eohools.
My objection to thie was the impossibility of my giving it with such
a critical dress as the learned world expects in the new edition
of a Greek Author. Not long afterwards, the same friend sent
me a copy of Hermann’s edition of this play, of which, though
published in the year 1831, I had not before heard. Ithen found
that thie illustriour critic had entirely changed his mind respecting

⁸ 'l'he mention of Porson in my Notec, unattended by any reference, applica to

bia Adversaris, p, 248, of Elmelay to Quartarlp Rectam, Vol. vrr. p. 4413 of Blam-
tield to Muscam criticam, Vol. 1. p. ret.
