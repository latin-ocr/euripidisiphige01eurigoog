188 Norns οις rus

τ’ οἷκτρδ καί τοί μήτ a sentiment, in which all point and pro-
priety would be lost.

ν.1152. Every edition before the present has Δεινιῖις δ’ ἔχει
με ταῦτα τολμῆσαι, τέκνον, nor has a suspicion been expressed
in regard to the phrase δ. δ’ ἔχει με. Reiske alone mentions μοι

as a conjecture, which he had himself repudiated. Nevertheless
it appears to me clear that the language requires δεινῶς δ’ ἔχει

μοι, asin v. 54. Τδ πρᾶγμα δ ἀπόρως εἶχε Τυνδάρεῳ πατρί.
870. καί γάρ δακρῦσαι ῥᾳδίως αὐτοῖς ἔχει, ’Aventia τΙ εἰπεῖν.

v. 1155. Χαλκὲων θ’ ὅπλων ίίνακτες Ἑλλήνων ὅσοι] Χαλὲ
κέων ὅπλων 11 in all edd. before Matthia, who inserted the copula
from three MSS. Compare with this expression Alcest. 514. {expri-
oov Opperiar πέλτης ἅναξ. Suppl. 680. μοναμπύκων ἅναξ.
Cycl. 86. Kolone τΙ ἄνακτας. lt is of little consequence whether
we read this sentence interrogatively or not

ν. 1158. Οὐδ ’ἔστι Τροίας ἐξελεῖν κλεινδν βάθρον] The
old reading was καινδν βόθρον, an undoubted corruption for
κλεινδν, as all scholare have admitted for the last 100 years: 1 be'-
lieve however that Reiske first propounded the emendation. κλιινδς
aud καινδς are words easily mistaken for one another: Elmsley
(on Herc. F. 38) cites several instances, but omits the present.
Markland would place this verse before the last ; but the sentences
follow the order in which the ideas presented themselves to the
mind of Agamemnon. I used to think that this line might
have been inserted from some lost drama of our Author, before I
saw a similer suspicion in Matthiae's note.

v. 1159. Μίμῃνε δ ἀφροδίτη τις Ἑλλήνων στρατῷ] α’φρο-
δίτη is here explained by ἐπιθυμία, one of the attributes of
Venus 3 as in Phoen. 410. Ἕχουσιν ἀφροδίτην τιν’ ἡδεῖαν κακων,
it implies another attribute, τέρψιν. ln both instanees τις is
attached to the name of the goddess. Itis really painful to ob·
serre the extent to which Hermann has suffered his love of 'subtilty
and relinernent to carry him. He objects to the metaphorical use
of Ἀφροδίτη in this line, because that goddess was not likely
παῦσαι λέκτρων α’ρταγδς, and also to the use of τις aster a
proper name, not advertiug to the line iu the Phoeniss. He then
prints a verse, which, had he found in any copy of a Tragedisn,
his ear would have repudiated, and his judgment condemned ς

ἔμηνε δὲ μακοίρων τις Ἑλλήνων στρατόν.
