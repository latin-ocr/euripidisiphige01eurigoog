offensive and more flat than usuali The repetition of words is by
no means the whole, or the worst part of the impeachment to
which these two lines are exposed: could the language bear
θύνασιν οι· δύναμιν ἔχει σθένειν rr?

v. 993. τό ἄσεπτον, scil. ἀσέβεια.
ν. 994. There is no necessity for the final ν in κατόπισθεν.

ν. 997. Kal κοινθς lydi βροτοῖς Μή τις θεῶν φθόνος
,ἔλθῃ 3] The common interpretation of this line is correct, Et
commune periculum mortalibus impendet, ne qna Deorum inuidia
omiat. Respecting θεῶν φθόνος, see the note of Monk on Alcest
1154, where this line is cited with ἔλθοι for Ιἔλθῃ, probably by
’ mistake. Matthiae and Hermann are resolved to find menningo
for this sentence never thought of hy the Poet The former ex-
plains it, “homines communiter in eo elaborant, ne dii, nimiae
hominis excellentiae invidentes, eam evertant'' The latter reads
nal μή sorvis, &c et non columnae certamen hominibus est, ne
deorum accedat indignatio. a’ytlv here implier risle or danger ; it
is needless to quote instances of a signification so common.

v. 999. 1000. Ι have taken out of the text five verses inter·
vening between these two; the reader will find them at the bottom
of the page, and when he has perused them, he will immediately
aohnowledge that the speech of Clytaemnestra is much improved
by their absence. 1 believe, indeed, that few people ever read
this Tragedy without feeling that those flat and useless lines con-
stitute a poor exordium of this highly interesting scene: but Ι
am the first writer who has ever hinted a suspicion of ¹their
being an interpolation 3 while the latest editor, Hermann, exerts
all his ingenuity and subtilty·to extract sense out of the most
desperate of them. They seem to have been intruded in order to
introduce Iphigenia, who, according to Euripides' intention, does
not come upon the stage till v. 1016. But it is not merely the
insipidity and unfitness of the verses upon which l ground my
objections: their language betrays their origin. The translatore
have, it is truc, endeavoured to give a sense in Latin which
might he suitable to the occasion; but on examination the Greek
words will not be found to bear the meaning with which their in.-
dulgent interpreters have invented them. Thus, πολλὰς ἱεῖσα μετα·
βολαῖς ὀδυρμάτων is rendered emittens multas variationes gemituum ;
but where could they find any thing like μεταβολαΙ ὀδυρμά-
των in such a sense? Θάνατον daoloao' iia τατῆρ, βουλεύεται
