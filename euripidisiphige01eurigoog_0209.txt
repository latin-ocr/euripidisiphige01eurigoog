178 NOTES ΟΝ THE

ejected, I have transposedthe two following lines, which in all·
the copies come aller 1079, but which Markland pereeived to be
required in this place. Iobserve that Potter in his translation has
actually adopted this transposition, without which indeed the argu·
ments of Clytaemnestra would be inconsequential: ἐπεὶ implies expla-
nation, but according to the common arrangement there is nothing to
which it can refer. The oration is now not only clear and nnembar-
rassed, but displaya the art of the Poet with very fine and delicate
touches. The anticipation of her condition during her husband's
absence, deprived by his cruelty of the society of her oldest daugh-
ter, forces upon the imagination of Clytaemnestra the lirst idea of that
guilty conduct, which in the sequcl of the story she adopted. She
therefore implores him not to drive her to such guilt, and then
explains what she means in the words κακῆι γενέσθαι περὶ od,
hy a threat, intimating the kind of reception which he might
expect on his return to Argos.

v. 1077. The only change which I have made in this passage
is με δεῖ for idea. Many editors have adopted Reiske's conjec-
ture ε’νδεῖτ but it seems as if the insertion of με is, if not indis-
pensablc, yet conducive to clearness, and δεῖ is much better than
icles in such a sentence. The construction is the same as in v.
1025, oridia κελευσμοῦ δεῖ σ’. See Porson on Orest. 659. Mat·
thiae and Hermann give explanations of this passage differing
widely from each other: the former, who reads or understands
σ’ ἔδει, explains it, Tam parum liberos amabas, ut levi tantum-
modo oausa opus tibi esset od occidendam filiam: quove male te ec-
cipiemus: the latter, Brevi aliquo praetentu uti poteras, at te et
ego et quaa relinquis Trojam petens filiae rioldi patrem-familias decet
reuertentem accipiamus. Whoever adopts either of these interpreta-
tione will lind that the force and spirit of the speech is evaporated
and lost. The latter sense indeed is plainly refuted by the words
παῖδες αἱ λελειμμέναι, which must imply the daughters who
would be left after the sacrifice oi Iphigenia. And the conclud-
ing words, δεξόμεθα δέξιν ἦν σε δέξασθαι’χρεῶν, contain an
intelligible menace, voe stall give you such a. receptisa os yon de-
seroe. In point of construction compare Bacch. 953. Κρῦψει ori
κρύψιν, ἥν σε κρυφθῆναι χρεών.

v. 1080. Etev. θύσεις δὲ τήν παῖδ’· εἶτα τίνας εὑχᾶς ipsis ς]
Ι have written sira instead of ἔνθα, which last signifies ιυΙιειι.
Markland’s proposal of σὴν for τήν is not merely unnecessary;
