existence ; ‘although hastily drawn up, they are for the most part
taken srom such observations as 1 noted down many years ago,
corrected and matur-ed by time, with little addition except refer-
ences to the commentarios of Matthiae and Hermann, and remarks
which occurred to me at the momentus their composition.

For the language of these Notes some apology is necessary. Ι
am aware indeed that the practice of affixing English commentarios
to Greek authors has of late been adopted, and its advantages have
been maintained hy several learned scholare of our country. But
in my own judgment the arguments greatly preponderate in
favour of the ancient channel of communication for 'this kind of
literature. Latin notes are accessible to scholare all over the world3
they have the recommendation of greater brevity3 and their con-
ventional phraseology is thoroughly recognised and established by
usage. On the contrary, verbal criticism in a vernacular language
has an uncouth appearance, as well as an abrupt and flippant tone,
diapleasing tc the reader and still more so to the writer. Its
adoption in this publication has not been the result ol' choice, but
of personal circumstances, which ·it would be useless ‘to explain.
About half the Notes were in fact written in Latin, when l found
that 1 could not carry them through the presswith any dec'ent
degree of accuracy, except in 'the vernaculas dress, into which
accordingly I translated them. ·

lt has been my study to assign improvements of the text to
the several scholars by who'm each was first propounded3 that
being the only unobjectionable rule in dispensing credit to critical
lucubratione. ln regard to recent criticisms, my knowledge of

them is derived from the notes of Matthia, printed in 1823, and
’ of Hermann, in 18313 and from the general accuracy of those
editors, 1 feel a security that few, it any, material omissione have
occurred up to the latter period. But os critical publications,
which may have appeared during the last nine years, 1 am almost
entirely ignorant& If therefore any of my emendations have been
anticipated in them, I hope that this will be accepted as a suffi-
cient apology for my silence.

It has been my desire to render to every one of my predecessore
ample credit for what he has done well, and to suppress or lightly
notice his failures. The many occasions upon which l have found

ι ” The Cambridge Philolcgical Muscam, and the Adversaris ol Professor
Dobree, form the only exceptione. ’
