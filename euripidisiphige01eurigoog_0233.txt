Elmsley proposed κοινὴν and οὐκ ἐμοὶ. Had he considered the

passage more maturely, 1 am convinced that he would have vith-
drawn both those alterations.

v. 1274. ἐχθρούς τε Ald. The correction is Reiske's. One
of the Paris MSS. has ἐχθρούς (γε, in the other there rs no
particle. Matthiae first placed the interr. at the end of v. 1275.

v. 1276. Aldus gives this line nr every corrupt state, Ti τά
δίκαιον τοῦ 7’; ip εχοιμεν ἀντειπεῖν επος; the manuscripts
have either τοντά 7 or τον 7 with το written over it. Of
this reading and of almost all the attempta madeat correction, I
will first observe that the opt. εχοιμεν used interrogatively, with-
out ἀν, ἰε, as 1 conceive, a solecism. Elmsley evades the main
difficulty3 he says (fn Edinh. Rev Vol xlx. p 92.) We do not
pretend to correct the whole verse; but we have little doubt that
the true reading of the latter hemistich rs εχομεν ἀντειπεῖν επος.”
Hermann gives Ti το δίκαιον rovrd7; ἀρ’ εχοιμ dv ἀντειπεῖν
εποςς a verse which retains two of the faults of the Aldine, the

expletive 7, and the want of the trochaic caesura. Porson de·
clares the line to be manifestly corrupt, but makes no attempt at
emendation. After the failure of these chiefs of the critical art,
it becomes me to speak very diffidently of my own essay. l shall
only mention the reasons which have moved me to give the fol·
lowing line, Ti το dinorov3 ,ἀρ ἐ’χοιμεν ‘rolod αν ἀντειπεῖν
επος; On the supposition that the beginning and end of the verse,
as given in the copies are correct, the only position which the words
ἀρ’ ἔχοιμεν could possibly have occupied rs that here allotted
to them If the reader will turn to v. 1105. he will observea
similarity to the case now before us, which makes' rt probable that
the corruption of both verses arose from the same cause, the
omission of αν before ἀντείποι in one, and ἀντειπεῖν in the other.
If then we have rightly corrected the former hythe insertion of
colori* αν, Ι think' rt follows that this requires the same remedy.
Here, however, 1 beheve that there was an additional cause for
error—the mistaken interpretation of the words τι’ το δικοιονς
which some read as if it had been vivificator, and inserted τοῦτ’
(for τοντο 7 is a mere metrical expedient)' m order to give what
they believed to be the speaker's meaning, Ηοιν ιι thir just? But
τί το decaron really significo, what ιι jur. tice? as Phoen. 558.
