Boeckh concludes that it belonged to the lost play. But it is more
probable that there is an error in the name. Indeed, the absence os
any attacks upon the Iphigenia in Aulis in a Comedy where Aris-
tophanes lashes so unsparingly most of his works, is an argument
that no such tragedy had appeared at the time of the representation
ι of the Rana, which, we know, was very 'shortly alter the death of
Euripides It was long ago suggested by Bergler that the allusion
intended by the Scholiast was to the Iphigenia m Tauria, v. 1089.

ἀπροσκοπα· Εὐριπίδης Ιφιγενεὶᾳ τη ἐν Αὐλίδι. But though
the word ddpauora' rs not found ιιι our Tragedy, it might once
have had a placem a line which has been lost Itis now admitted
on all hands that the final scene of this play has perished. See Notas
on v. 54 and v. 507. adly. Another argument of Boeckh for the
existence of a former Tragedy of Aulis is, that the author would
naturally composa first that piace the action of which was first in
order of time; that his Iphigenia in Tauris was certainly exhibited
durIng his life-time, as it undergoes the ridicule of Aristophanes
in the Ranoe, acted just aster his death, and was therefore prior
to this posthumous play. This argument, resting upon an assump-
tion that the Aulis must have been written first because its story
preceded that of the Tauric drama, does not require refutationss
canly, It is contended that as every other surviving Tragedy of
Euripides commences with a Prologus, this which begins with an
anapaestic dialogue cannot be his. But it is too much to conclude
that an author is unlikely ever to alter his practice, particularly
when it subjecta him to obloquy or ridIcule. The mannerism o'f
the Tragedian in detailing events to the audience is perfectly main-
tained by the long speech of Agamemnon immediately following
those anapaests; and the economy of the play is decidedly improved
¹ by this slight deviation from his ordinary practice.

Such are, as well as Iremember, the main arguments by which
Boeckh defends his hypothesis of this being the composition of the
younger Euripides, partly horrowed or altered from a former piece
written by his father. But a minute examination of the text, and
comparison with the other plays, convinced me that the suspicions
of Boeclrh were fallacious, that the existing Tragedy is the genuine
productiora of Euripides, entire with the exception of the last scene,
and that it isone of the most lively and characteristic specimens
